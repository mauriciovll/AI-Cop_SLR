Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on BD and BDA area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: Q1 – What are the different types of BD challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and Q2 – What are the different types of BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome BD challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the BDA research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of BD strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant BD research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the BDA in technology and organizational resource management discipline.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peppard, Joe</author><author>Edwards, Chris</author><author>Lambert, Rob</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploiting Big Data from mobile device sensor based apps</title><secondary-title>MIS Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MIS Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>115-117</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>15401960</isbn><accession-num>65266486</accession-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Peppard, Edwards, Lambert - MIS Quarterly.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The role of chief information officer (CIO) is riddled with ambiguity. To better understand the role, together with the causes and consequences of the ambiguity, we conducted interviews with CIOs, CxOs, recruiters, and industry analysts. Our findings indicate that this ambiguity is rooted in the fact that there are five distinct CIO roles: Utility IT Director, Evangelist CIO, Innovator CIO, Facilitator CIO, and Agility IT Director/CIO. The appropriate role for a particular organization at a point in time is determined by the criticality of information and technology for competitive differentiation and the maturity of its information leadership capabilities. Both are strongly influenced by the digital literacy of the CxO team. Moreover, our research suggests that in some organizations, the CIO roles follow a clear evolutionary path as some responsibilities that CIOs have assumed migrate away from the CIO and become embedded in CxO roles. We highlight the implications of this shift and provide specific recommendations for CIOs, CEOs, and CxOs as they seek to clarify the role of CIO so that they can optimize the value they generate from IT investments.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tambe, Prasanna</author><author>Hitt, Lorin</author><author>Rock, Daniel</author><author>Brynjolfsson, Erik</author><author>Berger, Guy</author><author>Mo, Di</author><author>Comin, Diego</author><author>Nagle, Frank</author><author>Syverson, Chad</author><author>Haskel, Jonathan</author><author>Selhat, Lynn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NBER WORKING PAPER SERIES DIGITAL CAPITAL AND SUPERSTAR FIRMS We are grateful for valuable feedback from</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2020 - Tambe et al. - Unknown.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nber.org/papers/w28285</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>General purpose technologies like information technology typically require complementary firm-specific investments to create value. These complementary investments produce a form of capital, which is typically intangible and which we call digital capital. We create an extended firm-level panel on IT labor investments (1990-2016) using data from LinkedIn. We then apply Hall's Quantity Revelation Theorem to compute both prices and quantities of digital capital over recent decades. We find that 1) digital capital prices vary significantly over time, peaking around the dot-com boom in 2000, 2) significant digital capital quantities have accumulated since the 1990s, with digital capital accounting for at least 25% of firms' assets by the end of our panel, 3) that digital capital has disproportionately accumulated in a small subset of &quot;superstar&quot; firms and its concentration is much greater than the concentration of other assets, and 4) that digital capital accumulation predicts firm-level productivity about three years in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grover, Varun</author><author>Chiang, Roger H.L.</author><author>Liang, Ting Peng</author><author>Zhang, Dongsong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Creating Strategic Business Value from Big Data Analytics: A Research Framework</title><secondary-title>Journal of Management Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Management Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>388-423</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>big data</keyword><keyword>big data analytics</keyword><keyword>big data capabilities</keyword><keyword>big data infrastructure</keyword><keyword>research framework</keyword><keyword>strategic business value</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07421222.2018.1451951</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Grover et al. - Journal of Management Information Systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Despite the publicity regarding big data and analytics (BDA), the success rate of these projects and strategic value created from them are unclear. Most literature on BDA focuses on how it can be used to enhance tactical organizational capabilities, but very few studies examine its impact on organizational value. Further, we see limited framing of how BDA can create strategic value for the organization. After all, the ultimate success of any BDA project lies in realizing strategic business value, which gives firms a competitive advantage. In this study, we describe the value proposition of BDA by delineating its components. We offer a framing of BDA value by extending existing frameworks of information technology value, then illustrate the framework through BDA applications in practice. The framework is then discussed in terms of its ability to study constructs and relationships that focus on BDA value creation and realization. We also present a problem-oriented view of the framework—where problems in BDA components can give rise to targeted research questions and areas for future study. The framing in this study could help develop a significant research agenda for BDA that can better target research and practice based on effective use of data resources.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>Selina Rtxbrl Paper Mav 2</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>XBRL</keyword><keyword>new accounting system</keyword><keyword>continuous monitoring</keyword><keyword>ad-hoc financial reporting</keyword></keywords><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Unknown - Unknown.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bucaro, Anthony C.</author><author>Jackson, Kevin E.</author><author>Lill, Jeremy B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Influence of Corporate Social Responsibility Measures on Investors' Judgments when Integrated in a Financial Report versus Presented in a Separate Report</title><secondary-title>Contemporary Accounting Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Contemporary Accounting Research</full-title></periodical><pages>665-695</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1911-3846.12542</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2020 - Bucaro, Jackson, Lill - Contemporary Accounting Research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This study examines the effect on investors' judgments of corporate social responsibility (CSR) measures when integrated with financial information in a single report versus when presented in a separate CSR report. Advocates for integrated reports argue that CSR information will be perceived as more relevant and have a greater impact on users when observed in an integrated report. However, we provide experimental evidence that CSR measures have greater influence on investors' judgments when investors observe the CSR information and financial information depicted in separate reports. We also provide evidence that this greater influence of CSR measures is caused by investors' evaluations taking on a “multidimensional perspective” that includes both a social responsibility and a financial dimension, which is triggered by observing the separate CSR report. Activating a social responsibility dimension elevates the perceived relevance of CSR measures, increasing their influence on investors' judgments. Our study contributes to practice by highlighting a potential unintended consequence of issuing integrated versus separate CSR reports: that investors incorporate CSR information less when it is integrated with financial information versus separately reported.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, He</author><author>No, Won Gyun</author><author>Wang, Tawei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SEC's cybersecurity disclosure guidance and disclosed cybersecurity risk factors</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Accounting Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Accounting Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>40-55</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>June</issue><keywords><keyword>Cybersecurity</keyword><keyword>Cybersecurity breach incident</keyword><keyword>Cybersecurity risk disclosure</keyword><keyword>Disclosure guidance</keyword><keyword>Risk factors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.accinf.2018.06.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Li, No, Wang - International Journal of Accounting Information Systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Cybersecurity risk disclosure has received great attention in the past several years, especially after the passage of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) cybersecurity disclosure guidance published on October 13, 2011. In this study, we examine the usefulness of cybersecurity-related risk factors disclosed in 10-K filings. We document that the presence of these risk factors in the pre-guidance period and length of these risk factors are related to future reported cybersecurity incidents. The association between the presence of cybersecurity risk disclosure and subsequently reported cybersecurity incidents becomes insignificant after the passage of the SEC's cybersecurity disclosure guidance. Our findings, in general, support the SEC's decision on emphasizing cybersecurity risk disclosure. However, SEC's disclosure guidance may unintentionally encourage firms to disclose cybersecurity risks regardless of the level of risks.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baboukardos, Diogenis</author><author>Rimmel, Gunnar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Value relevance of accounting information under an integrated reporting approach: A research note</title><secondary-title>Journal of Accounting and Public Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Accounting and Public Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>437-452</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2016.04.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Baboukardos, Rimmel - Journal of Accounting and Public Policy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2016.04.004</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This research note aims to enrich our understanding regarding the market valuation implications of financial reporting under an Integrated Reporting (IR) approach. In order to do so, we focus on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and we examine whether the value relevance of summary accounting information (i.e., book value of equity and earnings) of firms listed on the JSE has enhanced after the mandatory adoption of an IR approach under the King III Report. Our study can be seen as a response to the recent calls for a closer investigation of the usefulness of the new reporting trend for investors. More specifically, our study can be seen as a response to the stance taken by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) Framework that the adoption of an IR approach improves the usefulness of financial reporting for investors. For our empirical tests we utilize a sample of 954 firm-year observations and employ a linear price-level model which associates a firm's market value of equity with its book value of equity and earnings. In line with the IIRC Framework's expectations, we find strong evidence of a sharp increase of the earnings’ valuation coefficient. However, contrary to the Framework's stance, our results indicate a decline in the value relevance of net assets. Such a decline may be imputed to risks and/or unbooked liabilities that are revealed or measured more reliably after the introduction of an IR approach on the JSE. It should be noted, however, that despite its cause, the decline in the value relevance of net assets can be seen as a further argument in favor of the IIRC stance to assign equal importance to a wide range of “capitals,” such as human, social and natural capital. We believe that our findings are of particular interest to a wide range of regulators, standards setters, practitioners, and academics but first and foremost to the JSE and IIRC.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berkman, Henk</author><author>Jona, Jonathan</author><author>Lee, Gladys</author><author>Soderstrom, Naomi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cybersecurity awareness and market valuations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Accounting and Public Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Accounting and Public Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>508-526</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Cyber breaches</keyword><keyword>Cyber risks</keyword><keyword>Cybersecurity</keyword><keyword>Cybersecurity awareness</keyword><keyword>IT governance</keyword><keyword>Intangible assets</keyword><keyword>Market valuations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2018.10.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Berkman et al. - Journal of Accounting and Public Policy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2018.10.003</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper introduces a measure of firm-specific cybersecurity awareness that can be used in empirical research exploring cyber-related issues facing corporations. It extends and updates Gordon et al. (2010), who develop an indicator capturing the existence of disclosures related to “information security” and show a positive association between market valuation and their measure. Since publication of their paper, cyber-related events have become more frequent and salient, and disclosure of cybersecurity issues has become more extensive. Increased disclosure is largely due to a 2011 requirement by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides guidance for disclosure of cyber-related issues in 10-K filings. Based upon this post-guidance disclosure, we develop a new measure that captures the extent and relevance of cyber disclosures and show that the market positively values cybersecurity awareness. We also show that a more negative tone in cyber disclosures is associated with lower market values. Our results are robust to inclusion of measures of IT governance and controlling for the firm's overall disclosure characteristics.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Lei</author><author>Calderon, Thomas G.</author><author>Tang, Fengchun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Public companies' cybersecurity risk disclosures</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Accounting Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Accounting Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>100468</pages><volume>38</volume><keywords><keyword>Cyber security</keyword><keyword>Linguistic characteristics</keyword><keyword>Risk disclosure</keyword><keyword>Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.accinf.2020.100468</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2020 - Gao, Calderon, Tang - International Journal of Accounting Information Systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accinf.2020.100468</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Though cybersecurity risks are significant and could materially affect business operations and the integrity of financial reporting, there is limited empirical research on the cybersecurity risk disclosure trends and practices of public companies. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal study of the content and linguistic characteristics of public companies' cybersecurity risk disclosure practices as well as factors that may drive disclosure trends. The results show that the two most commonly disclosed cybersecurity risks are risks of service/operation disruption and risks of data breach. Item 1A of the 10-K Report is the most commonly used disclosure location, but some companies also use Items 1 and 7 to disclose regulation risks and cyber incidents, respectively. The length of cybersecurity risk disclosures increases linearly during the period of our study. This increase is associated with the issuance of SEC guidance (2011 and 2018), industry, overall cybersecurity risks in the general environment, company size, and prior cybersecurity breach incidents. Disclosures have also become more difficult to read in general. They are more difficult to read as firm size increases and are easier to read as the proportion of intangible assets increases or after an executive change. Firms have increased their usage of litigious words in their disclosures. Bigger firms, on average, tend to use less litigious language, but companies in industries with high business information technology intensity (e.g., consumer services, software and services, and banking) tend to use more litigious language than other companies.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheong, Arion</author><author>Yoon, Kyunghee</author><author>Cho, Soohyun</author><author>No, Won Gyun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classifying the contents of cybersecurity risk disclosure through textual analysis and factor analysis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>179-194</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cybersecurity</keyword><keyword>Factor analysis</keyword><keyword>Risk factor disclosure</keyword><keyword>Textual analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/ISYS-2020-031</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Cheong et al. - Journal of Information Systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Cybersecurity has garnered much attention due to the increasing frequency and cost of cybersecurity incidents and has become a significant concern for organizations and governments. Regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have also shown an interest in cybersecurity and the quality of cybersecurity risk disclosures. This paper examines the informativeness of cybersecurity risk disclosures when cybersecurity incidents or related internal control weaknesses are reported. In particular, we propose a quantitative methodology, which is a combination of textual analysis and factor analysis, for classifying cybersecurity risk disclosures into nine factors. Our results show different disclosing patterns among firms depending on whether they had cybersecurity incidents and internal control weaknesses. Further, our analysis indicates that firms disclose control-related factors to mediate the negative effect of disclosing vulnerability-related factors. This study provides various stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and researchers, with insight into the informativeness of cybersecurity risk disclosures.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berg, Florian</author><author>Kölbel, Julian F.</author><author>Rigobon, Roberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings*</title><secondary-title>Review of Finance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Review of Finance</full-title></periodical><pages>1315-1344</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Corporate social responsibility</keyword><keyword>Corporate sustainability</keyword><keyword>Divergence</keyword><keyword>ESG ratings</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/rof/rfac033</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2022 - Berg, Kölbel, Rigobon - Review of Finance.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This paper investigates the divergence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings based on data from six prominent ESG rating agencies: Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD), Sustainalytics, Moody’s ESG (Vigeo-Eiris), S&amp;P Global (RobecoSAM), Refinitiv (Asset4), and MSCI. We document the rating divergence and map the different methodologies onto a common taxonomy of categories. Using this taxonomy, we decompose the divergence into contributions of scope, measurement, and weight. Measurement contributes 56% of the divergence, scope 38%, and weight 6%. Further analyzing the reasons for measurement divergence, we detect a rater effect where a rater’s overall view of a firm influences the measurement of specific categories.

In particular, we analyze the content of over a million microblogs on Twitter relating to CSR in the banking industry. We focus on key issues considered by banks in their CSR reports, which we classify into Core or Supplementary depending on their connection with core business activities. We find that the use of Twitter to communicate CSR information in social media suggests that significant differences exist between the information interests of companies and stakeholders. Outside stakeholders focus on Core CSR issues, whilst firm insiders are relatively more likely to communicate Supplementary CSR issues. Firm insiders’ information dissemination appears biased towards favorable information, and consistent with a legitimacy-based use of social media. Event studies conducted on dates with significant exogenous CSR news confirm the findings of ‘parallel’ talking, and no resemblance in the CSR issues communicated by firms and stakeholders in social media.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ardia, David</author><author>Bluteau, Keven</author><author>Boudt, Kris</author><author>Inghelbrecht, Koen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate Change Concerns and the Performance of Green vs. Brown Stocks</title><secondary-title>Management Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Management Science</full-title></periodical><pages>7607-7632</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>&quot;Keywords: asset pricing</keyword><keyword>ESG</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>greenhouse gas emissions</keyword><keyword>sentometrics</keyword><keyword>sustainable investing</keyword><keyword>textual analysis&quot;</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year></dates><publisher>http://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc</publisher><isbn>0000000329</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1287/mnsc.2022.4636</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2023 - Ardia et al. - Management Science.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We empirically test the prediction of Pástor et al. (2021) that green firms outperform brown firms when concerns about climate change increase unexpectedly, using data for S&amp;P 500 companies from January 2010 to June 2018. To capture unexpected increases in climate change concerns, we construct a daily Media Climate Change Concerns index using news about climate change published by major U.S. newspapers and newswires. We find that on days with an unexpected increase in climate change concerns, the green firms’ stock prices tend to increase, whereas brown firms’ prices decrease. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we conclude that this effect holds for concerns about both transition and physical climate change risk. Finally, we decompose returns into cash flow and discount rate news components and find that an unexpected increase in climate change concerns is associated with an increase (decrease) in the discount rate of brown (green) firms.This paper was accepted by George Serafeim, Special Section of Management Science on Business and Climate Change.Funding: This work was supported by the National Bank of Belgium, Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), Institut de Valorisation des Données (IVADO), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2022-03767], and Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [Grants 179281, 191730].Supplemental Material: The data files and online appendix are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4636 .</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lyon, Thomas P.</author><author>Montgomery, A.

Drawing on the management literature on decoupling and the economic literature on information disclosure, we characterize specifically where this effect is likely to be most pronounced. We identify important differences between social media and traditional media, and present a theoretical framework for understanding greenwash in which corporate environmental communications may backfire if citizens and activists feel a company is engaging in excessive self-promotion. The framework allows us to draw out a series of propositions regarding the impact of social media on corporate decisions whether to greenwash, and what channels to use for environmental communication. We conclude with a number of suggestions for future research. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O’Leary, Daniel E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Armchair auditors: Crowdsourcing analysis of government expenditures</title><secondary-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</full-title></periodical><pages>71-91</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Armchair auditing</keyword><keyword>Auditing</keyword><keyword>Crowdsourcing</keyword><keyword>Open data</keyword><keyword>e-government</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/jeta-51225</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - O’Leary - Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Increasingly, there is interest in using information and communications technology (ICT) to help build a “better world.” As an example, the United Kingdom has initiated an “open data” movement to disclose financial information about federal and local governments and other organizations. This has led to the use of a wide range of technologies (Internet, Databases, Web 2.0, etc.) to facilitate disclosure. However, since there is a huge cost of generating and maintaining open data, there also is a concern: “will anyone do anything with the data?” In a speech in 2009, David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, used the term “armchair auditor” to describe crowdsourcing analysis of that data. In that speech, Cameron (2009) noted: “Just imagine the effect that an army of armchair auditors is going to have on those expense claims.” Accordingly, as more and more countries and organizations generate open data, those “armchair auditors” could play an increasingly important role: to help crowdsource monitoring of government expenditures. This paper investigates a number of potential benefits and a number of emerging concerns associated with armchair auditors.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Of, Journal</author><author>Technologies, Emerging</author><author>Accounting, I N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring with exogenous data (Med), and government economic monitoring (GEM)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/jeta-10682</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Of, Technologies, Accounting - Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The emergence of enormous disparate data sources, available in a multitude of alternate formats, and on very different devices, is leading to a business process revolution. This paper argues for a new approach in which these technologies are used to replace outdated blanket government intervention programs. Highly targeted interventions for social programs identified and addressed by Big Data-based methodologies would replace outdated government programs. This approach advocates for original detective methodologies, direct government action, and outcome monitoring all of which utilize Big Data-based frequent examination. The government would be in a privileged situation where it could obtain data not available to most other parties due to privacy laws. The data structures of the government would be protected by encryption and blockchain privacy-protection methodologies that would only reveal targeted outcomes to the direct-action agent. These same methodologies are applicable for business measurement (accounting) and assurance (audit).</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O’leary, Daniel E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Facilitating citizens’ voice and process reengineering using a cloud-based mobile app</title><secondary-title>Journal of Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>137-162</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>App confusion</keyword><keyword>Big data</keyword><keyword>Bos:311</keyword><keyword>Cloud computing</keyword><keyword>Exit</keyword><keyword>Layers of technology</keyword><keyword>Mobile app</keyword><keyword>Open data</keyword><keyword>Reengineering</keyword><keyword>Voice vs</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/isys-52244</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - O’leary - Journal of Information Systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Recently, the City of Boston implemented a mobile, cloud-based app. Originally called ‘‘Citizens Connect,’’ but now called ‘‘Bos:311,’’ the app allows citizens to report issues related to the city’s infrastructure, e.g., graffiti. Rich information in the form of pictures and descriptions provided from mobile devices, along with GPS location information, facilitates crowdsourcing monitoring of the city’s infrastructure. This app provides ‘‘straight through’’ processing of citizen requests, reengineering the processes of monitoring and fixing city infrastructure. As a result, operations and management accounting information can be more accurate and used in real time. In addition, the cloud-based capture of information from multiple cities allows comparisons and benchmarking of critical information that likely would not be possible in other settings, while allowing economic system use by large numbers of users. This paper investigates a number of hypotheses about the use of the mobile app generated from both Hirschman’s and Hammer’s theories.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prasad, Rajendra</author><author>Moore, Walter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Search of Fundamentals</title><secondary-title>Social Scientist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Social Scientist</full-title></periodical><pages>108</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>7/8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1989</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/3517291</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1989 - Prasad, Moore - Social Scientist.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We use search volume for firms' products to predict revenue surprises, earnings surprises and earnings announcement returns. We find that increases (decreases) in the search volume index (SVI) of a firm's most popular product strongly predicts positive (negative) revenue surprises. This predictive power is weaker for standardized unexpected earnings (SUE). SVI has strong predictability for returns around earnings announcements, especially among firms with few products, growth firms and firms that manage their reported earnings. Taken together, the evidence suggests that search volume for a firm's products is a value-relevent leading indicator about a firm's future cashflow that the market does not fully incorporate into prices until the earnings announcement.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Da, Zhi</author><author>Engelberg, Joseph</author><author>Gao, Pengjie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Search of Attention</title><secondary-title>Journal of Finance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Finance</full-title></periodical><pages>1461-1499</pages><volume>66</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01679.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Da, Engelberg, Gao - Journal of Finance.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We propose a new and direct measure of investor attention using search frequency in Google (Search Volume Index (SVI)).

The model uses freely available Google searches of firm products to provide external entity business state (EBS) evidence. The veracity of the reported numbers is enhanced when auditors can obtain external EBS evidence congruent with the reported numbers. The Google search volume index (SVI) of firm products is a good candidate for such EBS evidence because it nowcasts (i.e. predicts present) firm sales and is independent of management control. A large discrepancy such as a high sales growth together with a large decline in the SVI suggests possible manipulation upwards of revenues. We find that an indicator variable, MUP, of a firm in the top sales growth quartile and bottom ΔSVI quartile in each industry-quarter predicts revenue misstatements incrementally to the F_Score, Discretionary-Revenues model, two alternative upward revenue manipulation identifiers, and analyst and media coverages. MUP predictability is stronger in end-user industries and in interim quarters relative to the fourth quarter. We also find corroborating evidence that MUP firms have lower sales growth persistence, larger increases in accounts receivables, and lower allowances for bad debts, consistent with their lower revenue quality.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chang, Tom Y.</author><author>Huang, Wei</author><author>Wang, Yongxiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Something in the air: Pollution and the demand for health insurance</title><secondary-title>Review of Economic Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Review of Economic Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>1609-1634</pages><volume>85</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Projection bias</keyword><keyword>Salience</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/restud/rdy016</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Chang, Huang, Wang - Review of Economic Studies.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We find that daily air pollution levels have a significant effect on the decision to purchase or cancel health insurance in a manner inconsistent with rational choice theory.

While more companies offer ESG disclosure, it is usually not fully substantiated with supporting information. Assurance is needed to verify that ESG reports are free of substantive errors. However, traditional financial audit approaches are less effective in providing ESG assurance due to the difference in the nature of evidence, difficulty in measuring and verifying ESG measures, and ever-changing ESG performance. To increase the effectiveness of ESG audit approaches, this study proposes Audit 4.0-based ESG assurance, which uses Big Data and emerging technologies of Audit 4.0 to capture evidence from the physical world and provide accurate assurance on ESG reports in a timely manner. We further perform a case study as a proof of concept of the proposed approach, which explores the integration of satellite-based methane estimation as ESG audit evidence. The use of satellite images provides opportunities for regulators and companies to monitor and assure ESG reports in a continuous manner.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, Hengda</author><author>Stubben, Stephen R</author><author>Ton, Karen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Customer Shopping Behavior and the Persistence of Revenues and Earnings</title><secondary-title>Working Paper</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Working Paper</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>big data</keyword><keyword>customers</keyword><keyword>earnings persistence</keyword><keyword>market efficiency</keyword><keyword>revenues</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2022 - Jin, Stubben, Ton - Working Paper.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3744417Electroniccopyavailableat:https://ssrn.com/abstract=3744417</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Using GPS location data from customers' mobile devices that encompasses nearly 2.9 billion visits to over 1 million retail locations belonging to 286 U.S. firms, we develop new measures of customer shopping behavior (CSB) and show these to be associated with revenue and earnings persistence. Specifically, revenues and earnings are more persistent when a firm's customers (a) are repeat rather than one-time customers, (b) live closer to retail locations, (c) spend more time in retail locations, (d) have less variable shopping patterns, and (e) shop during the week rather than on weekends. After demonstrating that CSB can help to understand the implications of current revenues and earnings for the future, we examine whether investors, analysts, and managers fully incorporate CSB into their decisions. We find that investors and analysts do not fully incorporate CSB into trading decisions and revenue forecasts, which leads to predictable stock returns and forecast errors. However, investment decisions by managers align with CSB. Our results illustrate conditions under which revenues and earnings are sustainable and which stakeholder decisions are consistent with insights provided by customer data.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kang, Jung Koo</author><author>Stice-Lawrence, Lorien</author><author>Wong, Yu Ting Forester</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Firm Next Door: Using Satellite Images to Study Local Information Advantage</title><secondary-title>Journal of Accounting Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Accounting Research</full-title></periodical><pages>713-750</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>alternative data</keyword><keyword>big data</keyword><keyword>emerging technologies</keyword><keyword>institutional investors</keyword><keyword>local advantage</keyword><keyword>overweighting</keyword><keyword>processing costs</keyword><keyword>satellite images</keyword><keyword>store-level performance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1475-679X.12360</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Kang, Stice-Lawrence, Wong - Journal of Accounting Research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We use novel satellite data that track the number of cars in the parking lots of 92,668 stores for 71 publicly listed U.S. retailers to study the local information advantage of institutional investors. We establish car counts as a timely measure of store-level performance and find that institutional investors adjust their holdings in response to the performance of local stores, and that these trades are profitable on average. These results suggest that local investors have an advantage when processing information about nearby operations. However, some institutional investors do not adjust for the quality of their local information and continue to rely on local signals even when they are poor predictors of firm performance and returns. This overreliance on poor local information is reduced for institutional investors with greater industry expertise and those with greater incentives to maximize short-term trading profits.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bianchi, Pietro A.</author><author>Causholli, Monika</author><author>Minutti-Meza, Miguel</author><author>Villamil-Otero, Raul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social Networks Analysis in Accounting and Finance</title><secondary-title>SSRN Electronic Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SSRN Electronic Journal</full-title></periodical><issue>December</issue><keywords><keyword>Social network analysis</keyword><keyword>networks</keyword><keyword>interlocks</keyword><keyword>social ties</keyword><keyword>social capital</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2139/ssrn.3495299</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Bianchi et al. - SSRN Electronic Journal.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We study a family of 'classical' orthogonal polynomials which satisfy (apart from a three-term recurrence relation) an eigenvalue problem with a differential operator of Dunkl type.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dube, Svenja</author><author>Zhu, Chenqi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Disciplinary Effect of Social Media: Evidence from Firms' Responses to Glassdoor Reviews</title><secondary-title>Journal of Accounting Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Accounting Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1783-1825</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>CSR disclosure</keyword><keyword>real effect</keyword><keyword>social media</keyword><keyword>workplace practices</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1475-679X.12393</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Dube, Zhu - Journal of Accounting Research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We examine how firms respond to the increased workplace transparency due to the coverage on Glassdoor.com, which collects and disseminates reviews on employee satisfaction. Leveraging the staggered timing of first-time reviews on Glassdoor, we use a difference-in-differences design and find that after being reviewed on Glassdoor, firms improve their workplace practices, measured by corporate social responsibility scores on employee relations and diversity. Consistent with firms improving their workplace practices to remain competitive in the labor market, we find that such improvement concentrates in firms with negative initial reviews and with high labor intensity. We also find firms increase disclosures about workplace practices after being reviewed and the increase concentrates in firms with high institutional ownership, consistent with firms providing more disclosures to appease investors.

Our results show that information extracted from such text can be used to develop measures with useful properties for measuring misconduct risk. Specifically, the measures we develop clearly discriminate between high- and low-misconduct-risk firms and improve out-of-sample predictions of realized misconduct risk above and beyond other readily observable characteristics, such as Glassdoor firm ratings, firm size, performance, industry risk, violation history, and press coverage. We provide further evidence on the efficacy of our text-based measures of misconduct risk by showing that they are associated with future employee whistleblower complaints even after controlling for these same observable characteristics.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hope, Ole Kristian</author><author>Li, Congcong</author><author>Lin, An-Ping</author><author>Rabier, Mary Jane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Happy analysts</title><secondary-title>Accounting, Organizations and Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Accounting, Organizations and Society</full-title></periodical><pages>101199</pages><volume>90</volume><keywords><keyword>All-star</keyword><keyword>Analysts</keyword><keyword>Glassdoor</keyword><keyword>Job satisfaction</keyword><keyword>Labor market</keyword><keyword>Performance</keyword><keyword>Promotion</keyword><keyword>Social media</keyword><keyword>Work-life balance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aos.2020.101199</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Hope et al. - Accounting, Organizations and Society.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aos.2020.101199</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper is the first to investigate the role of work-life balance in financial analysts’ performance and career advancement.

The return effect is concentrated among reviews from current employees, stronger among early firm reviews, and also stronger when the employee works in the headquarters state. Decomposing employer ratings, we find the return effect is related to changing employee assessments of Career Opportunities and views of senior management. It is unrelated to work-life balance. Employer rating changes are associated with growth in sales and profitability and help forecast one-quarter-ahead earnings announcement surprises. The evidence is consistent with employee reviews revealing fundamental information about the firm.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Mi Jamie</author><author>Lei, Lijun Gillian</author><author>Wang, Jianling</author><author>Fan, Weiguo Patrick</author><author>Wang, Alan G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social media adoption and corporate disclosure</title><secondary-title>Journal of Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>23-50</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Corporate disclosure</keyword><keyword>Facebook</keyword><keyword>Social media</keyword><keyword>Technology adoption</keyword><keyword>Text classification</keyword><keyword>Twitter</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/isys-50961</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Zhou et al. - Journal of Information Systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This study examines 9,861 public firms to investigate the current adoption status of two popular social media platforms (Facebook™ and Twitter™) and their application in corporate disclosure. The investigation is based on the framework defined by Meek, Roberts, and Gray (1995) and on variations in platform, industry, firm size, time, and intensity (i.e., accounts owned, messages released, and user interaction). The results show that 49 percent of the firms have adopted one platform, and 30 percent have adopted both platforms. However, the numbers of new adopters on both platforms have been decreasing continuously since 2010, even though more than half of the firms are yet to adopt either platform. The results also show that 7.06 percent and 3.45 percent of Facebook and Twitter messages, respectively, are related to corporate disclosures. On average, users respond more quickly to disclosures released on Twitter (13 minutes) than on Facebook (25 minutes), whereas disclosures on Facebook have longer user engagement (427 minutes) than those on Twitter (10 minutes).</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lynch, Bradford</author><author>Taylor, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Information Content of Corporate Websites</title><secondary-title>SSRN Electronic Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SSRN Electronic Journal</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>corporate websites</keyword><keyword>voluntary disclosure</keyword><keyword>information environment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2139/ssrn.3791474</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Lynch, Taylor - SSRN Electronic Journal.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>In 2008, the SEC published guidance allowing firms to use corporate websites as an alternative disclosure channel to EDGAR. While the information content and market reaction to traditional disclosure channels such as EDGAR filings and press releases are well-documented, evidence on corporate websites as a disclosure channel is scarce. In this paper, we take the first step toward shedding light on corporate websites as an important source of information to investors. Employing standard event study methods, we develop a novel measure of corporate website content and find that increases in website content provide significant value-relevant information to investors incremental to that contained in traditional disclosure channels. In addition, we find a negative relation website content and information asymmetry, and that this negative relation is most pronounced after the SEC’s 2008 guidance. Collectively, our findings indicate that corporate websites are an economically significant source of new information that supplements traditional disclosure channels considered in prior literature.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heavey, Ciaran</author><author>Simsek, Zeki</author><author>Kyprianou, Christina</author><author>Risius, Marten</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How do strategic leaders engage with social media?

But, while studies on social media are popping up like kettle corn across disciplines, no conceptual framework for organizing, guiding, and inspiring research on social media engagement among strategic leaders has yet appeared. Toward this end, we first clarify the construct and develop a typological conceptualization of strategic leaders' social media engagement behaviors. Next, we introduce a theoretical framework and corresponding propositions for explaining the variations, mechanisms, and consequences of social media engagements. We conclude with implications for future research, including data collection and measurement. Managerial summary: With the growing proliferation of social media platforms, today's executives are faced with a vast array of choices about how to use social media to engage with diverse stakeholders and online communities. Although avoidance continues to be a preference for many executives, the scale and scope of social media platforms offer executives unprecedented opportunities—as well as risks—to engage stakeholders. We develop and illustrate a framework of six archetypal engagement behaviors through which executives may leverage social media to reach, communicate, and interact with stakeholders in developing and executing strategy—for both good and ill. We then discuss the implications of these alternative playbooks for executive decision-making and firm outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Elliott, W.

Results from an experiment show that investors trust the CEO more and are more willing to invest in the firm when the CEO communicates firm news followed by a negative earnings surprise through a personal Twitter account than when the news and surprise comes from the CEO via a website or from the firm's Investor Relations Twitter account or website. A follow-up experiment shows that repeating the negative news does not incrementally affect investors who received the news from the CEO's Twitter account, but does further negatively impact investors who received the news via other disclosure mediums, especially those who received the news via the Investor Relations Twitter account. Our results have implications for firms and executives considering the costs and benefits of communicating with investors via Twitter.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rozario, Andrea M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancing Substantive Analytical Procedures with Third-Party Generated Information from Social Media</title><secondary-title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</full-title></periodical><pages>1689-1699</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>analytical procedures</keyword><keyword>social media</keyword><keyword>nonfinancial information</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>9788578110796</isbn><accession-num>25246403</accession-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Rozario - Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Bin</author><author>Venkatachalam, Mohan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Leveraging Big Data to Study Information Dissemination of Material Firm Events</title><secondary-title>Journal of Accounting Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Accounting Research</full-title></periodical><pages>565-606</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>cell phone pings</keyword><keyword>material events</keyword><keyword>big data</keyword><keyword>price discovery</keyword><keyword>8-K filings</keyword><keyword>media</keyword><keyword>emerging technologies</keyword><keyword>disclosures</keyword><keyword>operational disruptions</keyword><keyword>product prices</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1475-679X.12419</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2022 - Li, Venkatachalam - Journal of Accounting Research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Could real-time big data help unravel material firm events? How would it compare with firm disclosure and traditional media in terms of timeliness and completeness? Could big data provide incremental value-relevant information for investors? With these questions in mind, we use a novel data set of cell phone “pings” (i.e., geolocation signals from mobile devices) to track production disruptions (outages)––material events for U.S. oil refineries. We first validate the construct by examining the effects of outages on local gas prices and firms’ accounting performance. Our main analyses show that (1) refining firms do not voluntarily disclose refinery outages identified by cell phone pings; (2) traditional media cover only a small portion of ping-based outages; (3) the stock market finds ping-based outages to be value relevant but incorporates the information with delay. Further analysis suggests that given the incomplete media coverage and lack of firm disclosure, investors appear to learn the financial impact of such outages through subsequent earnings announcements. Our evidence has implications for regulators such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission as they continue to evaluate both the compliance and usefulness of disclosures for material firm events such as production disruptions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dichev, Ilia D.</author><author>Qian, Jingyi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The benefits of transaction-level data: The case of NielsenIQ scanner data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Accounting and Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Accounting and Economics</full-title></periodical><pages>101495</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Consumer purchase</keyword><keyword>Equity valuation</keyword><keyword>Market efficiency</keyword><keyword>Transactional data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jacceco.2022.101495</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2022 - Dichev, Qian - Journal of Accounting and Economics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2022.101495</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This study explores whether NielsenIQ scanner data from U.S. retailers contain incremental information about the GAAP revenue of corresponding manufacturers. Using retail product/store/week data from 2006 to 2018, we construct a measure of aggregated consumer purchases at the manufacturer/quarter level, and find that it strongly predicts GAAP revenues. In addition, analyst forecasts of revenues have predictable errors, which implies that analysts do not fully incorporate the information in consumer purchases. Exploring investment implications, we find that hedge portfolios that buy (sell) stocks of firms with high (low) abnormal consumer purchases generate annualized returns on the magnitude of 14%–19%, depending on specification. Overall, these findings suggest that scanner data on consumer purchases provide an information edge over GAAP revenue, shedding light on the benefits of using transactional data.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allee, Kristian D.</author><author>Baik, Bok</author><author>Roh, Yongoh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detecting Financial Misreporting with Real Production Activity: Evidence from an Electricity Consumption Analysis*</title><secondary-title>Contemporary Accounting Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Contemporary Accounting Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1581-1615</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>accrual accounting</keyword><keyword>financial misreporting</keyword><keyword>forensic economics</keyword><keyword>fraud</keyword><keyword>nonfinancial information</keyword><keyword>real production</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1911-3846.12674</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Allee, Baik, Roh - Contemporary Accounting Research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This study examines whether a real production activity measure, firm-level electricity consumption growth, is useful in detecting firm financial misreporting. Identifying proxies for a firm's underlying financial performance that are not a function of the firm's accounting system is essential for detection of misreporting. We propose that the difference between revenue growth and electricity consumption growth (i.e., growth wedge (GW)) is a useful signal of financial misreporting. Using electricity consumption data for Korean firms from 2006 to 2014, we find that the GW is positively associated with discretionary revenues and accruals and the likelihood of financial misreporting as proxied by accounting restatements, qualified audit opinions, and regulatory enforcement actions. The GW provides incremental information over firm characteristics and earnings management signals examined by prior research. Our findings are robust to a battery of additional tests, including within-firm and industry comparisons that do not require access to cross-sectional firm-level electricity data. Overall, our study documents new evidence on the role of a real production activity measure from an independent reporting entity in detecting financial misreporting. Our evidence speaks to the potential usefulness of real activity metrics in forensic economics.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yoon, Kyunghee</author><author>Kogan, Alexander</author><author>Vasarhelyi, Miklos A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Weather Records as Audit Evidence</title></titles><periodical/><pages>1-48</pages><keywords><keyword>data analytics</keyword><keyword>nonfinancial information</keyword><keyword>revenue testing</keyword><keyword>substantive analytical procedures</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Yoon, Kogan, Vasarhelyi - Unknown.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>A growing number of studies have highlighted the impact of data and data analytics in auditing.

We study whether adding weather indices to statistical models built with financial indicators enhances the effectiveness of substantive analytical procedures. By using a dataset of daily store-level revenues from a multi-location retail firm with homogeneous operations in the United States, we show that the incremental value provided by weather indicators is limited and dependent upon season and region.

Users of online social media share information, connect with other people and stay informed about trending events. However, much recent information appearing on social media is dubious and, in some cases, intended to mislead. Such content is often called fake news. Large amounts of online fake news has the potential to cause serious problems in society. Many point to the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign as having been influenced by fake news. Subsequent to this election, the term has entered the mainstream vernacular. Moreover it has drawn the attention of industry and academia, seeking to understand its origins, distribution and effects. Of critical interest is the ability to detect when online content is untrue and intended to mislead. This is technically challenging for several reasons. Using social media tools, content is easily generated and quickly spread, leading to a large volume of content to analyse. Online information is very diverse, covering a large number of subjects, which contributes complexity to this task. The truth and intent of any statement often cannot be assessed by computers alone, so efforts must depend on collaboration between humans and technology. For instance, some content that is deemed by experts of being false and intended to mislead are available. While these sources are in limited supply, they can form a basis for such a shared effort. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the finding to date relating to fake news. We characterize the negative impact of online fake news, and the state-of-the-art in detection methods. Many of these rely on identifying features of the users, content, and context that indicate misinformation. We also study existing datasets that have been used for classifying fake news. Finally, we propose promising research directions for online fake news analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Vicki Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wisdom of Crowds: Cross-Sectional Variation in the Informativeness of Third-Party-Generated Product Information on Twitter</title><secondary-title>Journal of Accounting Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Accounting Research</full-title></periodical><pages>989-1034</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>wisdom of crowds</keyword><keyword>social media</keyword><keyword>product information</keyword><keyword>word of mouth</keyword><keyword>Twitter</keyword><keyword>fundamental analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1475-679X.12183</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Tang - Journal of Accounting Research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This paper examines whether third-party-generated product information on Twitter, once aggregated at the firm level, is predictive of firm-level sales, and if so, what factors determine the cross-sectional variation in the predictive power. First, the predictive power of Twitter comments increases with the extent to which they fairly represent the broad customer response to products and brands. The predictive power is greater for firms whose major customers are consumers rather than businesses. Second, the word-of-mouth effect of Twitter comments is greater when advertising is limited. Third, a detailed analysis of the identity of the tweet handles provides the additional insights that the predictive power of the volume of Twitter comments is dominated by “the wisdom of crowds,” whereas the predictive power of the valence of Twitter comments is largely attributable to expert comments. Furthermore, Twitter comments not only reflect upcoming sales, but also capture an unexpected component of sales growth.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheong, Arion</author><author>Duan, Huijue Kelly</author><author>Huang, Qing</author><author>Vasarhelyi, Miklos A.</author><author>Zhang, Chanyuan Abigail</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Rise of Accounting: Making Accounting Information Relevant Again with Exogenous Data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Big Data</keyword><keyword>ESG</keyword><keyword>accounting</keyword><keyword>assurance</keyword><keyword>auditing</keyword><keyword>business reporting</keyword><keyword>cybersecurity</keyword><keyword>exogenous data</keyword><keyword>external data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/jeta-10812</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2022 - Cheong et al. - Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Financial reporting and assurance in their current form are losing relevance to investors in firm valuations.

With the availability of Big Data and the advancement of technologies, the existing government reporting schema fails to meet the public’s increasing demand for accountability. We discuss the need for the government to reform its reporting schema and prescribe potential paths toward a data-driven, analytics-based, real-time, and proactive reporting paradigm. We conceptualize an app-based continuous monitoring and reporting environment that is real-time, structured, future-oriented, and that incorporates non-financial information like ESG and infrastructure. This reformed reporting paradigm highlights the expected role of government reporting: to provide accountability to the public.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alles, Michael G.</author><author>Dai, Jun</author><author>Vasarhelyi, Miklos A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reporting 4.0: Business reporting for the age of mass customization</title><secondary-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Accounting statements</keyword><keyword>Apps</keyword><keyword>Mass customization</keyword><keyword>Reporting 4.0</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><isbn>1558794018</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/JETA-10764</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Alles, Dai, Vasarhelyi - Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Financial reporting has evolved over centuries in distinct stages. The first reports (Reporting 1.0) were the trial balances ensuring that debits equaled credits, using the terminology popularized by Pacioli. The next major innovation was formalized in the Great Depression, with Reporting 2.0 being the standardized and audited financial statements. Reporting 3.0 evolved as technology was used to augment that reporting process with ERP-based data and XBRL. Today, technology is still relying on the automation of existing processes in Reporting 3.0. This paper proposes the move to Reporting 4.0, where technology will change reporting as fundamentally as Industry 4.0 is changing business operations. What characterizes Reporting 4.0 is the application of the intelligence inherent in 21st-century technology to create an app-based reporting system characterized by mass customization: the ability for reports to be tailored to meet the needs of the heterogeneous stakeholder community of the multi-objective modern enterprise.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brynjolfsson, Erik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>C Rowd -S Quared : a Mplifying the P Redictive P Ower of S Earch T Rend D Ata 1</title><secondary-title>MIS Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MIS Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>941-961</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>big data</keyword><keyword>crowdsourcing</keyword><keyword>data selection</keyword><keyword>prediction</keyword><keyword>search trends</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Brynjolfsson - MIS Quarterly.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Kelly</author><author>Li, Meng</author><author>Markov, Stanimir</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What do employees know?

We find that average employee outlook is incrementally informative in predicting future operating performance. Its information content is greater when the disclosures are aggregated from a larger, more diverse, more knowledgeable employee base, consistent with the wisdom of crowds phenomenon. Average outlook predicts bad news events more strongly than good news events, suggesting that employee social media disclosures are relatively more important as a source of bad news. Consistent with the organizational theory, we find systematic differences in the quantity and nature of the information in employee disclosures when the disclosures are grouped based on employee attributes and job responsibilities. Finally, average outlook predicts future returns of firms that attract less attention by analysts and investors, suggesting that investors in these firms use outlook inefficiently.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cho, Soohyun</author><author>Vasarhelyi, Miklos A.</author><author>Zhang, Chanyuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The forthcoming data ecosystem for business measurement and assurance</title><secondary-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting</full-title></periodical><pages>1-21</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Blockchain</keyword><keyword>Business assurance</keyword><keyword>Business measurement</keyword><keyword>Data ecosystem</keyword><keyword>Data integration</keyword><keyword>Exogenous Big Data</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Robotic/intelligent process automation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/jeta-10699</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Cho, Vasarhelyi, Zhang - Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>A data ecosystem is a combination of relevant data and the technologies used to integrate information feeding a particular process or a set of functionalities. With the advent of substantially improved computing and storage capabilities, sophisticated algorithms, and easier access to exogenous data, the data ecosystem is facilitating increasingly automated and continuous business measurement and assurance processes that reflect the rhythm and nature of business events and data sources. We propose that the big data used in business measurement and assurance must first be taxonomized and integrated, and then be processed by piggybacked applications to complement human activities to more effectively achieve operational and economic goals. We argue that the most notable technologies for the current wave of change are Robotic/Intelligent Process Automation, Machine Learning, Blockchain, and Continuous Measurement and Assurance applications. Furthermore, we discuss the main effects of the data ecosystem on the measurement and assurance of business activities.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Teoh, Siew Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The promise and challenges of new datasets for accounting research</title><secondary-title>Accounting, Organizations and Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Accounting, Organizations and Society</full-title></periodical><pages>109-117</pages><volume>68-69</volume><keywords><keyword>Analysts</keyword><keyword>Anomalies</keyword><keyword>Behavioral bias</keyword><keyword>Big data</keyword><keyword>Disclosure</keyword><keyword>Earnings</keyword><keyword>Glassdoor</keyword><keyword>Google trends</keyword><keyword>Limited attention</keyword><keyword>LinkedIn</keyword><keyword>Market efficiency</keyword><keyword>Psychological bias</keyword><keyword>Social network</keyword><keyword>Stock market returns</keyword><keyword>Textual data</keyword><keyword>Tone management</keyword><keyword>Twitter</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aos.2018.03.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Teoh - Accounting, Organizations and Society.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aos.2018.03.008</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>I describe a brief summary of the development of databases used in accounting research and discuss the research questions addressed in traditional databases and ‘new’ databases. The new data include online searches such as Google Trends data; textual data from corporate disclosures, analyst reports, conference call transcripts, earnings press releases, and news media articles; social network and social media data from Twitter, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and other data. New data holds promise for research on attention or cognitive processing constraints; on tone/valence, affect, deceptiveness and credibility for capital market and financial reporting outcomes. I examine the econometric challenges of new data and suggest the potential for new data to offer new auditing tools to detect poor financial reporting, which will help to discourage earnings management.</abstract></record><record><database name="Emerging-techs-articles.enl" path="Emerging-techs-articles.enl">Emerging-techs-articles.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bartov, Eli</author><author>Faurel, Lucile</author><author>Mohanram, Partha S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can twitter help predict firm-level earnings and stock returns?</title><secondary-title>Accounting Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Accounting Review</full-title></periodical><pages>25-57</pages><volume>93</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Abnormal stock returns</keyword><keyword>Analyst earnings forecast</keyword><keyword>Earnings</keyword><keyword>Social media</keyword><keyword>Twitter</keyword><keyword>Wisdom of Crowds</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2308/accr-51865</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Bartov, Faurel, Mohanram - Accounting Review.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Prior research has examined how companies exploit Twitter in communicating with investors, and whether Twitter activity predicts the stock market as a whole. We test whether opinions of individuals tweeted just prior to a firm’s earnings announcement predict its earnings and announcement returns. Using a broad sample from 2009 to 2012, we find that the aggregate opinion from individual tweets successfully predicts a firm’s forthcoming quarterly earnings and announcement returns. These results hold for tweets that convey original information, as well as tweets that disseminate existing information, and are stronger for tweets providing information directly related to firm fundamentals and stock trading. Importantly, our results hold even after controlling for concurrent information or opinion from traditional media sources, and are stronger for firms in weaker information environments. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the aggregate opinion from individual tweets when assessing a stock’s future prospects and value.</abstract></record></records></xml>
