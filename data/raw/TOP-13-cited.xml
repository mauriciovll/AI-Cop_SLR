Yet the public sector seems to be falling behind, despite the potential value of big data for government. Government organizations do recognize the opportunities of big data but seem uncertain about whether they are ready for the introduction of big data, and if they are adequately equipped to use big data. This paper addresses those uncertainties. It presents an assessment framework for evaluating public organizations’ big data readiness. Doing so demystifies the concept of big data, as it is expressed in terms of specific and measureable organizational characteristics. The framework was tested by applying it to organizations in the Dutch public sector. The results suggest that organizations may be technically capable of using big data, but they will not significantly gain from these activities if the applications do not fit their organizations and main statutory tasks. The framework proved helpful in pointing out areas where public sector organizations could improve, providing guidance on how government can become more big data ready in the future. © 2016, The Author(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="TOP-13-cited.enl" path="TOP-13-cited.enl">TOP-13-cited.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shah, Naimatullah</author><author>Irani, Zahir</author><author>Sharif, Amir M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Big data in an HR context: Exploring organizational change readiness, employee attitudes and behaviors</title><secondary-title>Journal of Business Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Business Research</full-title></periodical><pages>366-378</pages><volume>70</volume><keywords><keyword>Big data</keyword><keyword>Employee readiness</keyword><keyword>Extrinsic and intrinsic satisfaction</keyword><keyword>HR predictive analytics</keyword><keyword>Job satisfaction</keyword><keyword>Organizational change</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.08.010</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cited by: 149</notes><research-notes>Cited by: 149</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Shah, Irani, Sharif - Journal of Business Research.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0148296316304970</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This research highlights a contextual application for big data within a HR case study setting. This is achieved through the development of a normative conceptual model that seeks to envelop employee behaviors and attitudes in the context of organizational change readiness. This empirical application considers a data sample from a large public sector organization and through applying Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) identifies salary, job promotion, organizational loyalty and organizational identity influences on employee job satisfaction (suggesting and mediating employee readiness for organizational change). However in considering this specific context, the authors highlight how, where and why such a normative approach to employee factors may be limited and thus, proposes through a framework which brings together big data principles, implementation approaches and management commitment requirements can be applied and harnessed more effectively in order to assess employee attitudes and behaviors as part of wider HR predictive analytics (HRPA) approaches. The researchers conclude with a discussion on these research elements and a set of practical, conceptual and management implications of the findings along with recommendations for future research in the area. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="TOP-13-cited.enl" path="TOP-13-cited.enl">TOP-13-cited.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Desouza, Kevin C.</author><author>Jacob, Benoy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Big Data in the Public Sector: Lessons for Practitioners and Scholars</title><secondary-title>Administration &amp; Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Administration &amp; Society</full-title></periodical><pages>1043-1064</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>big data</keyword><keyword>policy analysis</keyword><keyword>public management</keyword><keyword>public organizations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0095399714555751</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cited by: 121</notes><research-notes>Cited by: 121</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Desouza, Jacob - Administration &amp; Society.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0095399714555751</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this essay, we consider the role of Big Data in the public sector.

The paper combines current research streams with long-standing discussions on government and technology in public policy and public administration, such as e-government and evidence-based policymaking. The goal is to answer the question whether big data is a fleeting trend or has long-lasting effects on policymaking. Three larger themes in the literature are identified: First, the role that institutional capacity has within government to utilize big data analytics; second, government use of big data analytics in the context of digital public services; and finally, the way that big data information enters the policy cycle, focusing on substantive and procedural policy instruments. Examples from the education, crisis management, environmental and healthcare domain highlight the opportunities and challenges for each of these themes. Exploring the various aspects of big data and policymaking shows that big data is here to stay, but that its utilization by government will take time due to institutional barriers and capacity bottlenecks. © 2017, The Author(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="TOP-13-cited.enl" path="TOP-13-cited.enl">TOP-13-cited.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wirtz, Bernd W.</author><author>Müller, Wilhelm M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An integrated artificial intelligence framework for public management</title><secondary-title>Public Management Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Management Review</full-title></periodical><pages>1076-1100</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Artificial intelligence</keyword><keyword>conceptual study</keyword><keyword>framework</keyword><keyword>public administration</keyword><keyword>public business model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14719037.2018.1549268</electronic-resource-num><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Wirtz, Müller - Public Management Review.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14719037.2018.1549268</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) extends the limits of current performance in data processing and analysis many times over. Since this states a great improvement in managing public data, this conceptual study discusses the use of AI in public management structures in connection with their risks and side effects. The exercise of state power and public influence through intelligent machines make ethical and political guidelines essential for their operation, constituting the cornerstones of the AI framework model developed here.

The article offers a tentative overview of the kind of algorithmic challenges facing public leaders in an environment where the discursive context is shaped by corporate technology companies.

This paper makes a contribution in this direction: it presents a novel approach, as well as the architecture of an ICT platform supporting it, for the advanced exploitation of a specific AI technology, namely chatbots, in the public sector in order to address a crucial issue: the improvement of communication between government and citizens (which has for long time been problematic). The proposed approach builds on natural language processing, machine learning and data mining technologies, and leverages existing data of various forms (such as documents containing legislation and directives, structured data from government agencies’ operational systems, social media data, etc.), in order to develop a new digital channel of communication between citizens and government. Making use of appropriately structured and semantically annotated data, this channel enables ‘richer’ and more expressive interaction of citizens with government in everyday language, facilitating and advancing both information seeking and conducting of transactions. Compared to existing digital channels, the proposed approach is appropriate for a wider range of citizens’ interactions, with higher levels of complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. In close co-operation with three Greek government agencies (the Ministry of Finance, a social security organization, and a big local government organization), this approach has been validated through a series of application scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="TOP-13-cited.enl" path="TOP-13-cited.enl">TOP-13-cited.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Tara Qian</author><author>Medaglia, Rony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping the challenges of Artificial Intelligence in the public sector: Evidence from public healthcare</title><secondary-title>Government Information Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Government Information Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>368-383</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Artificial Intelligence</keyword><keyword>Challenges</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Framing</keyword><keyword>Healthcare</keyword><keyword>Public sector</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.giq.2018.09.008</electronic-resource-num><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Sun, Medaglia - Government Information Quarterly.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0740624X17304781</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The nascent adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the public sector is being assessed in contradictory ways. But while there is increasing speculation about both its dangers and its benefits, there is very little empirical research to substantiate them. This study aims at mapping the challenges in the adoption of AI in the public sector as perceived by key stakeholders. Drawing on the theoretical lens of framing, we analyse a case of adoption of the AI system IBM Watson in public healthcare in China, to map how three groups of stakeholders (government policy-makers, hospital managers/doctors, and Information Technology (IT) firm managers) perceive the challenges of AI adoption in the public sector. Findings show that different stakeholders have diverse, and sometimes contradictory, framings of the challenges. We contribute to research by providing an empirical basis to claims of AI challenges in the public sector, and to practice by providing four sets of guidelines for the governance of AI adoption in the public sector.</abstract></record><record><database name="TOP-13-cited.enl" path="TOP-13-cited.enl">TOP-13-cited.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Desouza, Kevin C.</author><author>Dawson, Gregory S.</author><author>Chenok, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Designing, developing, and deploying artificial intelligence systems: Lessons from and for the public sector</title><secondary-title>Business Horizons</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Business Horizons</full-title></periodical><pages>205-213</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Artificial intelligence applications</keyword><keyword>Cognitive computing systems</keyword><keyword>Innovation management</keyword><keyword>Technology adoption</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bushor.2019.11.004</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cited by: 143</notes><research-notes>Cited by: 143</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2020 - Desouza, Dawson, Chenok - Business Horizons.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007681319301582</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Artificial intelligence applications in cognitive computing systems can be found in organizations across every market, including chatbots that help customers navigate websites, predictive analytics systems used for fraud detection, and augmented decision-support systems for knowledge workers.

Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; ``optimising'' the employment services'' in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen - or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="TOP-13-cited.enl" path="TOP-13-cited.enl">TOP-13-cited.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aoki, Naomi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An experimental study of public trust in AI chatbots in the public sector</title><secondary-title>Government Information Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Government Information Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>101490</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Administrative discretion</keyword><keyword>Artificial intelligence</keyword><keyword>Chatbot</keyword><keyword>Human-machine relationship</keyword><keyword>Public service</keyword><keyword>Public trust</keyword><keyword>Street-level bureaucracy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.giq.2020.101490</electronic-resource-num><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2020 - Aoki - Government Information Quarterly.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0740624X1930406X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This study investigates the public's initial trust in so-called ``artificial intelligence'' (AI) chatbots about to be introduced into use in the public sector. While the societal impacts of AI are widely speculated about, empirical testing remains rare. To narrow this gap, this study builds on theories of operators' trust in machines in industrial settings and proposes that initial public trust in chatbot responses depends on (i) the area of enquiry, since expectations about a chatbot's performance vary with the topic, and (ii) the purposes that governments communicate to the public for introducing the use of chatbots. Analyses based on an experimental online survey in Japan generated results indicating that, if a government were to announce its intention to use ``AI'' chatbots to answer public enquiries, the public's initial trust in their responses would be lower in the area of parental support than in the area of waste separation, with a moderate effect size. Communicating purposes that would directly benefit citizens, such as achieving uniformity in response quality and timeliness in responding, would enhance public trust in chatbots. Although the effect sizes are small, communicating these purposes might be still worthwhile, as it would be an inexpensive measure for a government to take.</abstract></record><record><database name="TOP-13-cited.enl" path="TOP-13-cited.enl">TOP-13-cited.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Busuioc, Madalina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accountable Artificial Intelligence: Holding Algorithms to Account</title><secondary-title>Public Administration Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration Review</full-title></periodical><pages>825-836</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/puar.13293</electronic-resource-num><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Busuioc - Public Administration Review.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.13293</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms govern in subtle yet fundamental
ways the way we live and are transforming our societies. The promise of
efficient, low-cost, or ``neutral'' solutions harnessing the potential
of big data has led public bodies to adopt algorithmic systems in the
provision of public services. As AI algorithms have permeated
high-stakes aspects of our public existence-from hiring and education
decisions to the governmental use of enforcement powers (policing) or
liberty-restricting decisions (bail and sentencing)-this necessarily
raises important accountability questions: What accountability
challenges do AI algorithmic systems bring with them, and how can we
safeguard accountability in algorithmic decision-making? Drawing on a
decidedly public administration perspective, and given the current
challenges that have thus far become manifest in the field, we
critically reflect on and map out in a conceptually guided manner the
implications of these systems, and the limitations they pose, for public
accountability.</abstract></record><record><database name="TOP-13-cited.enl" path="TOP-13-cited.enl">TOP-13-cited.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zekić-Sušac, Marijana</author><author>Mitrović, Saša</author><author>Has, Adela</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine learning based system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as an approach towards smart cities</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Information Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Information Management</full-title></periodical><pages>102074</pages><volume>58</volume><keywords><keyword>Planning models Energy efficiency Machine learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102074</electronic-resource-num><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2021 - Zekić-Sušac, Mitrović, Has - International Journal of Information Management.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0268401219302968</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Energy efficiency of public sector is an important issue in the context of smart cities due to the fact that buildings are the largest energy consumers, especially public buildings such as educational, health, government and other public institutions that have a large usage frequency. However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment.</abstract></record></records></xml>
