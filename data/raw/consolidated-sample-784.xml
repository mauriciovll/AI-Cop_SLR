      <abstract>Efficient monitoring and achievement of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) has increased the need for a variety of data and
statistics. The massive increase in data gathering through social
networks, traditional business systems, and Internet of Things
(IoT)-based sensor devices raises real questions regarding the capacity
of national statistical systems (NSS) for utilizing big data sources.
Further, in this current era, big data is captured through sensor-based
systems in public sector organizations. To gauge the capacity of public
sector institutions in this regard, this work provides an indicator to
monitor the processing capacity of the public sector organizations
within the country (Pakistan). Some of the indicators related to
measuring the capacity of the NSS were captured through a census-based
survey. At the same time, convex logistic principal component analysis
was used to develop scores and relative capacity indicators. The
findings show that most organizations hesitate to disseminate data due
to concerns about data privacy and that public sector organizations&#39; IT
personnel are unable to deal with big data sources to generate official
statistics. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be used to
overcome these challenges, such as automating data processing, improving
data privacy and security, and enhancing the capabilities of IT human
resources. This research helps to design capacity-building initiatives
for public sector organizations in weak dimensions, focusing on
leveraging AI to enhance the production of quality and reliable
statistics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Almost every public sector department produces some statistics and accumulates its share in the formulation of National Statistics. The accurate and timely statistics are vital for planning and development, budgeting and evaluation of the implemented programs. It may be reasonable to assume that datasets are being produced at almost all levels of the departments; nonetheless, a substantial number of valuable data-items are left unreported and hence they are unable to play their role in evidence-based planning and decision-making. There is a need to uncover these sources, to explore the reasons behind the non-reporting of data and to devise strategies to utilize these sources in the production of official statistics. In this paper, we present the results of a national-level survey conducted to collect information on data-processing and reporting mechanisms of public-sector organizations in Pakistan. Along with presenting the survey results, the paper discusses the potential sources of unreported data (including Big Data), the reasons for non-reporting at different sectoral levels and the confidentiality, privacy, and data-sharing constraints. Based on the above, the paper ends by proposing the compilation of a Directory of Administrative Data Sources (DADS) in order to establish an improved administrative infrastructure in the country. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The purpose of the study is to draw an understanding of the phenomenon of using artificial intelligence (AI) in human resources, especially in the Kingdom of Bahrain. This research effort provides a future perspective of using AI to better understand the attitudes and perspectives of HR practitioners within multiple frameworks. The study revealed that the Kingdom of Bahrain with the implementation of its vision (2030 vision), the public sector will have a great opportunity to keep up with the digital transformation. This has led to a change in the composition of the workforce within business organizations. It lets women and men have competed in many jobs, and this will add a new burden on human resources management as a result of the demand for gender equality. In addition, this allows for the great integration of the feminist element. It is urged that the applications of modern artificial intelligence (AI) is an essential approach for organizations that work in an inconsistent environment. © 2020 IJSTR.</abstract>

      <abstract>To address the rising energy demands in industrial and public sectors, integrating zero-carbon emission energy sources into the power grid is crucial. Smart grids, equipped with advanced sensing, computing, and communication technologies, offer an efficient way to incorporate renewable energy resources and manage power systems effectively. However, improving solar energy efficiency, which currently contributes around 3.6% to global electricity, is a challenge in smart grid infrastructures. This research tackles this issue by deploying machine learning models, specifically recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gate recurrent unit (GRU), to predict measurements that could enhance solar power generation in smart grids. The objective is to boost both performance and accuracy of solar power generation in the smart grid. The study conducts experimental analyses and performance evaluations of these models in smart grid environments, considering factors like power output, irradiance, and performance ratio. The results, presented through graphical visualizations, show notable improvements, particularly with the LSTM model, which achieves a 97% accuracy, outperforming the RNN and GRU models. This outcome highlights the LSTM model&#39;s effectiveness in accurately predicting measurements, thereby advancing solar power generation efficiency in the smart grid framework. © 2024 The Authors.

      <abstract>What is the impact of automation on public sector employment? Using
machine learning and natural language processing algorithms, this study
estimates which occupations and agencies of the Brazilian Federal
Government are most susceptible to automation. We contribute to the
literature by introducing Bartik Occupational Tasks (BOT), an objective
method used to estimate automation susceptibility that avoids subjective
or ad hoc classifications. We show that approximately 20% of Brazilian
public sector employees work in jobs with a high potential of automation
in the coming decades. Government occupations with lower schooling and
lower salary levels are most susceptible to future automation.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this conceptual paper, we explore how artificial intelligence (AI)
holds promise as an important and additional tool for combating
corruption in public procurement in emerging economies. We aim to extend
the understanding of how the emergent technology of Al may be another
important tool in the fight against corruption in emerging economies. We
discuss how AI and related emergent technologies can help build greater
accountability and transparency regimes in public procurement, a key
source of public corruption. We argue that there are infrastructural,
social, ethical, and political challenges to the successful use of
emerging technologies of AI in the fight against public corruption. We
make inferences from the discussion and provide some tentative
guidelines for policymakers. We suggest that using AI as part of a
program of institutional reforms in the public sector would increase
technology&#39;s role and contributions to the fight against systemic
corruption in public procurement in emerging economies.</abstract>

      <abstract>Due to increasing urbanization, nowadays, cities are facing challenges spanning multiple domains such as mobility, energy, environment, etc. For example, to reduce traffic congestion, energy consumption, and excessive pollution, big data gathered from legacy systems (e.g., sensors not conformant with modern standards), geographic information systems, gateways of public administrations, and Internet of Things technologies can be exploited to provide insights to assess the current status of a city. Moreover, the possibility to perform what-if analyses is fundamental to analyzing the impact of possible changes in the urban environment. The few available solutions for scenario definitions and analyses are limited to addressing a single domain and providing proprietary formats and tools, with scarce flexibility. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel scenario model and editor integrated into the open-source Snap4City.org platform to enable several processing and what-if analyses in multiple domains. Different from state-of-the-art software, the proposed solution responds to a series of identified requirements, implements NGSIv2-compliant data models with formal descriptions of the urban context, and a scenario versioning method. Moreover, it allows us to carry out analyses on different domains, as shown with some examples. As a case study, a traffic congestion analysis is provided, confirming the validity and usefulness of the proposed solution. This work was developed in the context of CN MOST, the National Center on Sustainable Mobility in Italy, and for the Tourismo EC project. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Rising rates of NCDs threaten fragile healthcare systems in low- and middle-income countries. Fortunately, new digital technology provides tools to more effectively address the growing dual burden of disease. Two-thirds of the world&#39;s population subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2018, while the falling price of connectivity and the 5G networks rollout promise to accelerate the use of digital technology. Properly leveraged, we can employ digital solutions and applications to transform health systems from reactive to proactive and even preventive, helping people stay healthy. With artificial intelligence (AI), health systems can be made more predictive by detecting risk factors and helping health professionals respond faster to prevent disease. Yet this rapid pace of growth has also complicated the digital health landscape. Myriad digital health apps compete and overlap in the public and private sectors, and significant gaps in the collection and analysis of digital data threaten to leave some behind. Established in 2010, the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development is led by ITU and UNESCO and advocates for the transformational impact of broadband technologies for development. Its working group on digital and AI in health, co-chaired by the Novartis Foundation and at different times Nokia, Intel and Microsoft, identifies best practices for countries to realize the potential of digital technology in health and care. Interviewing more than 100 key stakeholders and reviewing over 200 documents, the Working Group set out to identify common challenges that countries face in implementing digital health solutions, and to develop a framework that countries can use to build systems for supporting digital health solutions. Common challenges include a lack of coordination leading to fragmented digital health solutions; lack of systems and workforce capacity to manage data and digital technology, and inadequate financing to support digital health. The working group proposes six building blocks for digital health systems: formulate and execute a national digital health strategy; create policy and regulatory frameworks that support innovation while protecting security and privacy; ensure access to digital infrastructure; ensure interoperability of digital health system components; establish effective partnerships; and sustain adequate financing. © 2021</abstract>

      <abstract>Technology-driven disruption is taking place at a pace and scale not witnessed before in history. Waves of technology, such as the internet of things, big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, are reshaping our personal and professional lives in profound ways. A new world is emerging in which many of the current job classes will disappear, while new ones, requiring entirely different sets of skills, are emerging. Public administrators are unprepared for the challenges they must face in order to cope with this nonincremental and exponential change. Many of the existing government structures and processes that have evolved over the last few centuries will likely become irrelevant in the near future. There is a compelling need to lay the groundwork for governments to rethink how they will be able to best serve their constituents. © 2018 by The American Society for Public Administration</abstract>

      <abstract>The goal of e-government is to provide public services to end users - be it citizens or residents - of a given nation. Research has shown that there is the susceptibility of governments to check all the boxes so as to present an image of having e-government implementations, yet end users eventually do not benefit from these electronic services. Quality public service delivery is an issue of priority today and, with the increasing availability of modern technological tools and techniques, it is attainable. Datadriven e-government is a necessary ingredient in the modern day public sector due to the widespread availability and rapid production of data (i.e. big data) and it aims at value creation. This study proposes a novel research concept, using the Multi-Channel Service Delivery model as a catalyst to attain the data-driven ecosystem in the public sector. The model was developed based on recommendations from works of previous research to address the changing landscape of the public sector. By integrating the Multi-Channel Service Delivery model into e-government and public sector decision making, governments will be able to bridge the divide and offer services to end users with access to e-services, as well as those who do not. In doing so, the United Nations&#39; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which are aimed at leaving none behind will be arrived at. © 2010 Sociedad Mexicana de Psicologia.

      <abstract>The evident benefits of big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning in society have begun to influence the transition towards a data-driven public sector. Decision-making in the public sector is in an infancy phase of a revolution owing to the inclusion of these new technological innovations. Research has revealed that data-driven e-government policies improve socio-economic development in some nations. Despite the immense opportunities data-driven e-government models have for governments, similar to every system, there are ramifications. This study explores the concept of data-driven e-government as well as investigates the socio-economic implications such an e-government model can have on society. Findings of this exploratory study add insight into a field which is in its early days and still unfocused, as well as making recommendations for policymakers. © 2019, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

      <abstract>Introduction Fifty per cent of patients with cancer require radiotherapy during their disease course, however, only 10%-40% of patients in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) have access to it. A shortfall in specialised workforce has been identified as the most significant barrier to expanding radiotherapy capacity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software has been developed to automate both the delineation of anatomical target structures and the definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to minutes) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy. Methods ARCHERY is a non-randomised prospective study to evaluate the quality and economic impact of AI-based automated radiotherapy treatment planning for cervical, head and neck, and prostate cancers, which are endemic in LMICs, and for which radiotherapy is the primary curative treatment modality. The sample size of 990 patients (330 for each cancer type) has been calculated based on an estimated 95% treatment plan acceptability rate. Time and cost savings will be analysed as secondary outcome measures using the time-driven activity-based costing model. The 48-month study will take place in six public sector cancer hospitals in India (n&#x3D;2), Jordan (n&#x3D;1), Malaysia (n&#x3D;1) and South Africa (n&#x3D;2) to support implementation of the software in LMICs. Ethics and dissemination The study has received ethical approval from University College London (UCL) and each of the six study sites. If the study objectives are met, the AI-based software will be offered as a not-for-profit web service to public sector state hospitals in LMICs to support expansion of high quality radiotherapy capacity, improving access to and affordability of this key modality of cancer cure and control. Public and policy engagement plans will involve patients as key partners.  © 2023 BMJ. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public administration frequently deals with geographically scattered
personal data between multiple government locations and organizations.
As digital technologies advance, public administration is increasingly
relying on collaborative intelligence while protecting individual
privacy. In this context, federated learning has become known as a
potential technique to train machine learning models on private and
distributed data while maintaining data privacy. This work looks at the
trade-off between privacy assurances and vulnerability to membership
inference attacks in differential private federated learning in the
context of public administration applications. Real-world data from
collaborating organizations, concretely, the payroll data from the
Ministry of Education and the public opinion survey data from Asia
Foundation in Afghanistan, were used to evaluate the effectiveness of
noise injection, a typical defense strategy against membership inference
attacks, at different noise levels. The investigation focused on the
impact of noise on model performance and selected privacy metrics
applicable to public administration data. The findings highlight the
importance of a balanced compromise between data privacy and model
utility because excessive noise can reduce the accuracy of the model.
They also highlight the need for careful consideration of noise levels
in differential private federated learning for public administration
tasks to provide a well-calibrated balance between data privacy and
model utility, contributing toward transparent government practices.</abstract>

      <abstract>In recent era, networks of data are growing massively and forming a shape of complex structure. Data scientists try to analyze different complex networks and utilize these networks to understand the complex structure of a network in a meaningful way. There is a need to detect and identify such a complex network in order to know how these networks provide communication means while using the complex structure. Social network analysis provides methods to explore and analyze such complex networks using graph theories, network properties and community detection algorithms. In this paper, an analysis of co-authorship network of Public Relation and Public Administration subjects of Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) is presented, using common centrality measures. The authors belong to different research and academic institutes present all over the world. Cohesive groups of authors have been identified and ranked on the basis of centrality measures, such as betweenness, degree, page rank and closeness. Experimental results show the discovery of authors who are good in specific domain, have a strong field knowledge and maintain collaboration among their peers in the field of Public Relations and Public Administration. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>Government employees play a critical role in adopting and using new technologies in government, and their attitude and willingness to use them matter in creating a sustainable and meaningful digital transformation. This study explores how the perception of government employees shapes the willingness to support the use of AI technologies in government. Based on a survey data on current government employees in the U.S., our analysis reveals that the willingness to implement and use AI technologies in government was contingent upon a series of positive and negative perceptions about the new technologies, long-term outlook on the role of AI technologies in society, and the familiarity and experience in using some form of AI applications in the past. In particular, the perception of AI enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the work and a positive and longer-term outlook on AI&#39;s future about human labor (as an assistant or a competitor), the perception of the technology&#39;s ultimate harm or benefit (does it harm or benefit humanity), its ability to eventually make ethical and moral judgments influenced the willingness to support AI technologies in government. A substantial proportion of the government employees in the survey sample responded that they had experienced using some form of AI applications in their work and this familiarity had a strong positive influence on their support for AI. Our findings point to the importance of training the government employees in AI technologies to improve their understanding and perception about the new technologies as well as their potentials in government that will foster a culture of innovation toward sustainable and impactful digital transformation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a qualitative, computationally assisted examination of prominent content patterns in the 2001–2016 National Audit Office of Finland (NAOF) performance audit reports and foremost changes in these patterns. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: Without ex ante researcher decisions on which content elements are important, the authors use computational content analysis of topic modelling for detecting content patterns and their changes in the performance audit reports. Findings: In the content patterns, professional effectiveness auditing stands out, whereas efficiency auditing is more weakly present. Other content patterns correspond to the NAOF institutional position and its audit mandate, the institutional characteristics of Finland’s public sector, and independent NAOF decisions in orienting its work. The authors can discern both ascendant, ascendant and stabler content patterns. Research limitations&#x2F;implications: As the paper emphasises textual analysis, examining from where changes in the content patterns derive is secondary. Implications for both more intensive and extensive future research are drawn. Practical implications: The authors argue that together with other approaches the approach has potential in monitoring Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) performance auditing in the level of its contents. Social implications: Knowing how an SAI orients its performance auditing has potential to support SAI monitoring by stakeholders – Parliament, the government, the citizens and others. Originality&#x2F;value: This is a comprehensive examination of the content patterns of the performance audit reports of an SAI since the 2001 introduction of its present institutional position. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>This systematic literature review examines United Arab Emirates (UAE) public sector artificial intelligence (AI) use, impact, and challenges. Using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol, 20 relevant Scopus articles were selected for the study. Data from selected articles were used to analyse AI&#39;s use, benefits, and drawbacks in the UAE&#39;s public sector. Quality assessment was done throughout the review process. The results showed that AI is being used more in the UAE&#39;s public sector to improve efficiency, cost savings, decision-making, and service delivery. The review also found data, privacy, security, technical, infrastructure, AI, and user challenges. Publication bias and the lack of AI studies in the UAE&#39;s public sector limit the study. The findings have major implications for policy and practice, emphasising the need for AI strategies and UAE-specific solutions. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

      <abstract>Freight demand forecasting models used by federal, state, and local transportation agencies to predict future freight flows are often based on economic forecasts of industry growth and&#x2F;or commodity production&#x2F;consumption rates which are then used to estimate expected freight movement, e.g., truck volumes. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data connecting industry served and commodity carried to freight movements which limits the accuracy and usability of such models. While the private sector collects robust data on freight movements including commodity carried, when shared with the public sector, this data is anonymized to protect privacy. Thus, there is a critical need to re-identify industry served and commodity carried from anonymous freight movement data in ways that maintain privacy standards. To address this research gap, we developed a classification model using data mining and machine learning methods to predict industry served by a truck from daily activity patterns of trip and stop sequences extracted from truck Global Positioning System (GPS) data. A Weighted Random Forest (WRF) supervised machine learning model is used to predict five industry groups: farm products, mining materials, chemicals, manufactured goods, and miscellaneous mixed goods. The WRF model achieves 88% prediction accuracy and explicitly accounts for class imbalance. The model does not reveal fleet, driver, company, etc. and thus, we are able to provide necessary insight into the relationship between truck movement and economic (industry) forecasts without violating data privacy standards. Ultimately, our model allows large streams of truck movement data to be leveraged for freight travel demand forecasting. © 2021 Tongji University and Tongji University Press</abstract>

      <abstract>The main objective of the study was to analyze the historical evolution of administrative law in Jordan from 1970 to the present. The research methodology involved the use of historical analysis and hermeneutics method. The historical analysis revealed significant developments in the development of administrative law in Jordan from 1970 to the present. In particular, the period from 1970 to 2000 was broadly characterized by intense reforms aimed at modernizing public administration and legislation to promote social justice and economic growth. With the advent of digital technologies, from 2000 to 2024 there was a significant impact of artificial intelligence on administrative processes, generating new opportunities to optimize public management and improve the quality of services provided to citizens. In the global context, administrative law has also gone through a difficult path of adaptation to new challenges such as globalization and rapid tech-nological change. It is concluded that, through constant adaptation and dialectical innovation, administrative law continues to provide effective and fair governance that meets the needs of modern society. © 2024, Ediciones Clio.

      <abstract>Businesses have grown more sophisticated in their use of data, which drives new demands that require different ways to handle this data. Data management solutions on their own are becoming very expensive and unable to cope with the reality of everlasting data complexity. Forward-thinking organisations believe that the only way to solve the data problem will be the implementation of effective data governance. Attempts to govern data failed before, as they were driven by information technology (IT), and affected by rigid processes and fragmented activities carried out on a system-by-system basis. Until very recently, governance remained mostly informal, with very ambiguous and generic regulations in silos around specific enterprise repositories, lacking structure and the wider support of the organisation. Despite its highly recognised importance, the area of data governance is still underdeveloped and under-researched. In the cloud computing context, the cloud brings new issues of data governance, where the loss of governance is one of the top risks of cloud computing. Thus, before adopting the cloud, the organisations should develop a cloud data governance programme. It is important, therefore, to understand the enabling factors for successful implementation of cloud data governance in organisations. However, as every organisation has its own constraints and requirements, the phrase ‘no one size fits all’ applies in this case. This study focuses on the case of the public sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the aim of this research is to identify the enabling factors in adopting and implementing cloud data governance in the Saudi public sector. The study&#39;s sample covered the largest and most important Saudi public sector organisations, with questionnaires distributed to relevant employees. The results of the study were based on 206 respondents, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to evaluate these results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big data has been widely associated with business enterprises. Recent theoretical and practical evidence denote that the use of Big data by government can boost service quality, accountability and decision-making. This paper draws on knowledge-based theory (KBT) to demonstrate how government data analytics (GDA) practices fosters innovation, absorptive and citizens-demand sensing capability in the public sector. Survey data were obtained randomly from employees working in the Jordanian Interior ministry and a fuzzy sets (fsQCA) technique was used to analyse the data. According to the findings from fsQCA: GDA practices and organisational tenure are the necessary recipes for innovative capability, citizens-demand sensing capability and absorptive capability. However, employees age, income and education were not important recipes. Implications for theory and practices are discussed alongside the limitations and future research direction.

      <abstract>This paper first merges two noteworthy aspects of choice. On the one hand, soft sets and fuzzy soft sets are popular models that have been largely applied to decision making problems, such as real estate valuation, medical diagnosis (glaucoma, prostate cancer, etc.), data mining, or international trade. They provide crisp or fuzzy parameterized descriptions of the universe of alternatives. On the other hand, in many decisions, costs and benefits occur at different points in time. This brings about intertemporal choices, which may involve an indefinitely large number of periods. However, the literature does not provide a model, let alone a solution, to the intertemporal problem when the alternatives are described by (fuzzy) parameterizations. In this paper, we propose a novel soft set inspired model that applies to the intertemporal framework, hence it fills an important gap in the development of fuzzy soft set theory. An algorithm allows the selection of the optimal option in intertemporal choice problems with an infinite time horizon. We illustrate its application with a numerical example involving alternative portfolios of projects that a public administration may undertake. This allows us to establish a pioneering intertemporal model of choice in the framework of extended fuzzy set theories. © 2018 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The execution of public sector construction projects often requires the use of financial resources not foreseen during the tendering phase, which causes management problems. This study aims to present a computational model based on artificial intelligence, specifically on artificial neural networks, capable of forecasting the execution cost of construction projects for Brazilian educational public buildings. The database used in the training and testing of the neural model was obtained from the online system of the Ministry of Education. The neural network used was a multilayer perceptron as a backpropagation algorithm optimized through the gradient descent method. To evaluate the obtained results, the mean absolute percentage errors and the Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Some hypothesis tests were also carried out in order to verify the existence of significant differences between real values and those obtained by the neural network. The average percentage errors between predicted and actual values varied between 5% and 9%, and the correlation values reached 0,99. The results demonstrated that it is possible to use artificial intelligence as an auxiliary mechanism to plan construction projects, especially in the public sector.

      <abstract>Abstract: The article presents the Small and Medium Enterprise Growth Index (SMEs), developed by the Stolypin Institute for the Economy of Growth based on the data of PAO Sberbank. The tool proposed by the authors allows not only to carry out operational monitoring of the state of the SME sector, but also to assess the effectiveness of state policy aimed at developing the SME sector, including with the aim of designing further measures to support it. In the context of a pandemic and sanitary and epidemiological restrictions, according to the results of the 1st–3rd quarters of 2020, the index showed moderate growth in the SME sector, close to “stagnation” (+5.8 p.). At the same time, the growth of the index relative to the 2nd quarter of 2020, during which the decline in business activity was maximum, amounted to +1 p. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public sector organizations increasingly use artificial intelligence to augment, support, and automate decision-making. However, such public AI can potentially infringe on citizens’ right to autonomy. Contestability is a system quality that protects against this by ensuring systems are open and responsive to disputes throughout their life cycle. While a growing body of work is investigating contestable AI by design, little of this knowledge has so far been evaluated with practitioners. To make explicit the guiding ideas underpinning contestable AI research, we construct the generative metaphor of the Agonistic Arena, inspired by the political theory of agonistic pluralism. Combining this metaphor and current contestable AI guidelines, we develop an infographic supporting the early-stage concept design of public AI system contestability mechanisms. We evaluate this infographic in five workshops paired with focus groups with a total of 18 practitioners, yielding ten concept designs. Our findings outline the mechanisms for contestability derived from these concept designs. Building on these findings, we subsequently evaluate the efficacy of the Agonistic Arena as a generative metaphor for the design of public AI and identify two competing metaphors at play in this space: the Black Box and the Sovereign. © 2024 Tongji University and Tongji University Press</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important and emerging sub-discipline
in information technology that is progressively being implemented in
every field. It is gradually being introduced to support new forms of
research, discovery, and reuse of library contents in advanced and
interesting ways. University libraries have the potential to
substantially improve their library services through the implementation
of sophisticated AI tools. This study explored the application of AI
tools in the university libraries of Pakistan, as well as draw a
comparison in the usage of AI tools between public and private sector
universities. This is a quantitative study and data is collected through
survey methodology. We used purposive sampling to collect the data from
175 university libraries. The collected data was analyzed using a
statistical package for social sciences (SPSS-version 22). Findings
indicate that while AI-based services are starting to be introduced into
university libraries in Pakistan, no university library has implemented
the full suite of AI-based tools. Natural language processing, voice
searching, and chatbots are the most familiar and popular tools
currently used in libraries. However, robotics technology is rarely used
with a mean value of (1.62) because of the financial investment and high
level of IT skills required. We found that private university libraries
are using AI tools more as compared with public sector university
libraries. The study concludes with several key recommendations,
including closer collaboration between the library and the respective
university IT department for technical support and assistance; improved
financial support and ICT infrastructure to establish AI
technology-based library services; and training development plans for
library staff. Insights gained from this study should contribute to the
capacity of Pakistani University librarians and their staff to maximize
the full potential of AI within their institutions. The research
implications are helpful to library leaders and policymakers in building
a policy for AI-based technology in their respective university
libraries.</abstract>

      <abstract>The concept of lean management has been of interest to researchers and practitioners in the construction industry and is implemented in most countries. While achieving waste mitigation in developed countries, lean is still in its elementary stages in the Middle East. Moreover, the implementation in the Middle East poses more challenges than benefit when choosing the right lean tools and techniques for projects. This study will critically investigate the factors affecting the process of adopting lean tools and techniques, which are directed towards technology, artificial intelligence and IoT in the construction industry in the public sector in the four governates of the Kingdom of Bahrain. Thereafter, the investigation will determine the level of lean construction management implementation and consequently its effect on sustainability using a quantitative method. The result from the questionnaire is hoped to shed a light on the poorly researched topic in Bahrain and benefit academics and practitioners. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>Administrative bodies in the European Union (EU) and its Member States increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to make sense of complex scenarios. However, scholarship and practice have both shown that the adoption of AI in the public sector is accompanied by various risks, such as algorithmic discrimination or lack of oversight over decision-making. This article proposes that analyses of administrative decision-making in the age of AI must account for automated uncertainty, that is, for the uncertainty stemming from using AI in the public sector. Automated uncertainty is closely connected to the technical opacity of AI systems-but, unlike traditional forms of scientific uncertainty, it affects not only the facts but also the very decision-making structures of public administration. As a result, traditional remedies for uncertainty in administrative decision-making do not fully respond to the implications of AI-based automation for the procedural duties governing administrative decision-making. The article accordingly concludes with proposals of how administrative law scholarship can account for automated uncertainty and ensure that the use of AI does not erode the safeguards provided by the legal framework for administrative decision-making. © 2023 The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>The current article pinpoints technical service error as a pillar of administrative responsibility for artificial intelligence (AI) operations. To achieve the research objectives, the descriptive and analytical approach is appropriated and adapted. The technical service error, being one of the pillars of administrative responsibility for artificial intelligence work, necessitates pointing out that the service error has degrees of seriousness. The administrative judiciary distinguishes between serious and non-serious errors, depending on the nature of administrative activities and services, especially after the digital transformation of numerous services provided by the government carried out through artificial intelligence technology. The awareness about the legal system for service errors in the field of administrative responsibility resulting from the use of artificial intelligence techniques is attained through identifying the errors committed by the administration during the exercise of its physical and legal work, considering that service errors play a major role in establishing administrative responsibility, especially with the technical development witnessed by public facilities. © Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (ZUJ).</abstract>

      <abstract>People text millions of posts everyday on microblogging social networking especially Twitter which make microblogs a rich source for public opinions, customer&#39;s comments and reviews. Companies and public sectors are looking for a way to measure the public response and feedback on particular service or product. Sentiment analysis is an encouraging technique capable to sense the public opinion in a fast and less cost tactic than traditional survey methods like questionnaires and interviews. Various sentiment methods were developed in many languages, such as English and Arabic with much more studies in the first one. Sometime, hash tags are misleading or may have a title that does not really reflects the subject. Tweets in trend hash tags may contain keyword or topics titles better represent the subject of the hash tag. This research aims at proposing an approach to explore Twitter Hash tag trends to retrieve tweets, group retrieved tweets to learn topics&#39; profiles, do sentiment analysis to test the subjectivity of tweets then develop a prediction model using deep learning to classify a new tweet to the appropriate topic profile. Arabic hash tags trends have been used to evaluate the proposed approach. The performance of the proposed approach (clustering topics within hashtag trend to learn topics profiles then do sentiment analysis) shows better accuracy than sentiment analysis without clustering the topics. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>Addressing undeclared work is a high priority in the labor field for
government policymakers since it adversely affects all involved parties
and results in significant losses in tax and social security
contribution revenues. In the last years, the wide use of ICT in labor
inspectorates and the considerable progress in data exchange have
resulted in numerous databases dispersed in various units, yet these are
not effectively used to increase their functions productivity.
This study presents a detailed analysis of a data mining project per the
CRISP-DM methodology aiming to assist the labor inspectorates in dealing
with undeclared work and other labor law violations. It uses real past
inspections data merged with companies characteristics and their
employment details and examines the application of two Associative
Classification algorithms, the CBA and CBA2, in combination with two
types of datasets, a binary and a four-class. The produced models are
assessed per the data mining goals and per the initial business
objectives, and the research concludes proposing an innovative
inspections recommendation tool proved to offer two major benefits: a
mechanism for planning targeted inspections of improved efficiency and a
knowledge repository for enhancing the inspectors understanding of those
features linked with labor law violations.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly adopted as
decisional aides by public bodies, with the promise of overcoming biases
of human decision-makers. At the same time, they may introduce new
biases in the human-algorithm interaction. Drawing on psychology and
public administration literatures, we investigate two key biases:
overreliance on algorithmic advice even in the face of &#x60;&#x60;warning
signals&#39;&#39; from other sources (automation bias), and selective adoption
of algorithmic advice when this corresponds to stereotypes (selective
adherence). We assess these via three experimental studies conducted in
the Netherlands: In study 1 (N &#x3D; 605), we test automation bias by
exploring participants&#39; adherence to an algorithmic prediction compared
to an equivalent human-expert prediction. We do not find evidence for
automation bias. In study 2 (N &#x3D; 904), we replicate these findings, and
also test selective adherence. We find a stronger propensity for
adherence when the advice is aligned with group stereotypes, with no
significant differences between algorithmic and human-expert advice. In
study 3 (N &#x3D; 1,345), we replicate our design with a sample of civil
servants. This study was conducted shortly after a major scandal
involving public authorities&#39; reliance on an algorithm with
discriminatory outcomes (the &#x60;&#x60;childcare benefits scandal&#39;&#39;). The
scandal is itself illustrative of our theory and patterns diagnosed
empirically in our experiment, yet in our study 3, while supporting our
prior findings as to automation bias, we do not find patterns of
selective adherence. We suggest this is driven by bureaucrats&#39; enhanced
awareness of discrimination and algorithmic biases in the aftermath of
the scandal. We discuss the implications of our findings for public
sector decision making in the age of automation. Overall, our study
speaks to potential negative effects of automation of the administrative
state for already vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens.</abstract>

      <abstract>The main motivation of this study is to forecast the performance of Indian banks using multiple regression analysis and artificial neural network and to compare these two methods for the accuracy. To achieve this goal, financial data spread over 10 years from 2010 to 2019 was collected from 19 Indian public sector banks. The data consists of 17 financial ratios collected from financial statements and other publications of the sample organizations. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CRAR) has been chosen as dependent variable for measuring and predicting the financial strength of banks. Identification of significant ratios that are determinants of CRAR are identified by using regression technique then these identified ratios are used as input for a developing a neural network model. The findings of multi-linear regression analysis identified 7 financial ratios that have a positive relationship between with dependent variable (CRAR). These 7 dependent variables were used to predict the financial strength (CRAR) of the Banks. Then a feed forward back propagation neural network was developed with these 7 dependent variables to predict the CRAR. Finally, the performances of these two methods were measured by using the Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). The results indicate that ANN model scores an improvement of 55.67% in MSE over regression model. In RMSE which re-scales the errors in order to keep the errors’ dimension as the predicted value, ANN model scores an improvement of 33.425% over regression model. It also indicates that ANN model scores an improvement of 99.32% over regression model in MAPE which measures the magnitude of absolute errors in relative terms. Results show that ANN model outperforms the regression model and is superior technique of forecasting CRAR of Indian Banks. © 2020, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

      <abstract>This predictive correlational study investigated the extent to which the expectation confirmation model can predict the intention of students to continue using virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). It also examined the relationships of satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and the confirmation level with the intention to continue using. The data were collected through an e-questionnaire in which 367 male and female students from the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) participated. They had previously used computer applications and software through the VDI for a number of their courses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that satisfaction and perceived usefulness were statistically significant in predicting that the students intended to continue VDI use. The confirmation level indirectly predicted the students&#39; intention to continue using VDI through its effect on satisfaction and perceived usefulness. The findings suggest that it is important to improve learning experiences through VDI to raise students&#39; satisfaction due to its impact on their intention to continue using VDI. The study also recommends that more research be conducted in the field of VDI to explore other factors that explain and contribute to continued VDI use.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to transform the public sector by combining the leading technical and business trends of mobility, automation, and data analysis to dramatically alter the way public bodies collect data and information. Embedded sensors, actuators, and other devices that capture and transmit information about network activity in real-time are used in the Internet of Things to connect networks of physical objects. The design of a network management system for an IoT network is presented in this paper, which uses the edge computing model. This design is based on the Internet management model, which uses the SNMP protocol to communicate between managed devices, and a gateway, which uses the SOAP protocol to communicate with a management application. This work allowed for the identification and analysis of the primary network management system initiatives for IoT networks, in which there are four fundamental device management requirements for any deployment of IoT devices: provisioning and authentication, configuration and control, monitoring and diagnostics, and software updates and maintenance.  © 2021 Mohammad Alsaffar et al.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been suggested to have transformative
potential for public sector organizations through enabling increased
productivity and novel ways to deliver public services. In order to
materialize the transformative potential of AI, public sector
organizations need to successfully assimilate AI in their operational
activities. However, AI assimilation in the public sector appears to be
fragmented and lagging the private sector, and the phenomena has really
limited attention from academic research community. To address this gap,
we adopt the case study approach to explore three Saudi-Arabian public
sector organizations and analyze the results using the attention-based
view of the organization (ABV) as the theoretical lens. This study
elucidates the challenges related AI assimilation in public sector in
terms of how organizational attention is focused situated and
distributed during the assimilation process. Five key challenges emerged
from the cases studied, namely (i) misalignment between AI and
management decision-making, (ii) tensions with linguistics and national
culture, (iii) developing and implementing AI infrastructure, (iv) data
integrity and sharing, and (v) ethical and governance concerns. The
findings reveal a re-enforcing relationship between the situated
attention and structural distribution of attention that can accelerate
the successful assimilation of AI in public sector organizations.</abstract>

      <abstract>School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic have transferred learning online, in the first experience of online learning for most students in Saudi Arabia. This study specifically examines the barriers facing Secondary school students, providing suggestions for overcoming these barriers, as gathered from educational technology specialists. A mixed methodology was adopted, with interviews first being carried out with four parents and four students to discover details of the barriers that they face. This helped develop an online survey involving 518 respondents to identify the most frequently cited barriers. Curriculum barriers had the most impact in terms of hindering the learning process, followed by teaching, the learning environment, and social barriers. These four barriers were significantly greater in public-sector schools, compared to private schools. There were also statistically significant differences between male and female students. Moreover, students with access to digital devices and the Internet experienced more teaching barriers, learning environment barriers, and social barriers than those who did not. The survey results were presented to educational technology experts to suggest solutions to the problems of technology adoption. The above experts agreed on the need for a virtual learning environment (VLE) that would help develop students&#39; selflearning, research, and critical thinking skills. © 2021.

      <abstract>The development of fuzzy sets in geographic information systems (GIS) arose out of the need to handle uncertainty and the ability of soft computing technology to support fuzzy information processing. Fuzzy logic is an alternative logical foundation coming from artificial intelligence (AI) technology with several useful implications for spatial data handling. GIS has been found to have a crucial role in the performance of public sector organizations (PSO). However, the literature shows no universal model to support and shed light on GIS adoption, which lessens the chances for effective GIS adoption and usage. Therefore, a new model is needed for successful adoption and eventual enhanced organization&#39;s performance. Thus, there is a need to investigate the factors that can bring about GIS adoption. Models for GIS adoption in literature are few and far between, and the few that exist are not applicable as they do not cover all the significant factors that can contribute to adoption success. Hence, this paper brought a GIS adoption model for PSOs to promote their performance. The model was developed through the extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in addition to the DeLone and McLean&#39;s Success Model. The study involved interviews with ten experts in ranking the extracted factors, and data was analyzed through thematic analysis. On the basis of the obtained analysis findings, the fundamental factors were found to be significant in their effects, and GIS adoption sufficiently related to the overall performance. Thus, the study contributes to the body of knowledge by filling the gap in the literature.  © 2021 Nouf Abdulaziz Alzahrani et al.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Fourth Industrial Revolution (I4.0) envisages fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds, and is transforming production, management and governance into a Smart Manufacturing paradigm. It is based on exploitation of current and futuristic technologies such as Internet of Things, 3D Printing (Additive Manufacturing), 5 G connectivity, cyber security, robotics and automation. More than any other industry, defence innovation and manufacturing demand high quality and precision products. This paper brings out the need and current status of India’s defence manufacturing sector (state-controlled Defence Research and Development Organisation(DRDO), Ordnance Factories (OFs), Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), and Private Industry including MSMEs) with regard to I4.0, and seeks to establish what needs to be done in adopting features of smart manufacturing, to make it globally competitive. Primary data obtained from a small but knowledgeable sample population, duly analysed with descriptive statistics; followed by secondary data sources, establish the influencing factors. Interpretive Structural Modelling helped formulate a framework for smart manufacturing in India’s defence industry. The paper concludes with recommendations with regard to governmental, and industry stakeholders. © BEIESP.</abstract>

      <abstract>Machine learning (ML) methods have gained a great deal of popularity in
recent years among public administration scholars and practitioners.
These techniques open the door to the analysis of text, image and other
types of data that allow us to test foundational theories of public
administration and to develop new theories. Despite the excitement
surrounding ML methods, clarity regarding their proper use and potential
pitfalls is lacking. This article attempts to fill this gap in the
literature through providing an ML &#x60;&#x60;guide to practice&#39;&#39; for public
administration scholars and practitioners. Here, we take a foundational
view of ML and describe how these methods can enrich public
administration research and practice through their ability develop new
measures, tap into new sources of data and conduct statistical inference
and causal inference in a principled manner. We then turn our attention
to the pitfalls of using these methods such as unvalidated measures and
lack of interpretability. Finally, we demonstrate how ML techniques can
help us learn about organizational reputation in federal agencies
through an illustrated example using tweets from 13 executive federal
agencies. All R code, analyses, and data described in this article can
be found in the Supplementary Appendix.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public administration scholarship has to a significant degree neglected
technological change. The age of the algorithm and big data&#39; is throwing
up new challenges for public leadership, which are already being
confronted by public leaders in different jurisdictions. Algorithms may
be perceived as presenting new kinds of wicked problems&#39; for public
authorities. The article offers a tentative overview of the kind of
algorithmic challenges facing public leaders in an environment where the
discursive context is shaped by corporate technology companies. Public
value theory is assessed as an analytical framework to examine how
public leaders are seeking to address the ethical and public value
issues affecting governance and regulation, drawing on recent UK
experience in particular. The article suggests that this is a fruitful
area for future research.</abstract>

      <abstract>Data Science emerged as a new cross-disciplinary discipline at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and expertise in a specific domain, such as health and biology. The data science field, alongside other data-related professions, is continuously evolving. We conducted a study examining tasks assigned to first-year internship students pursuing a Master&#39;s degree in Health Data Science, exploring the missions, technologies employed and skills required, and internship alignment with students&#39; training through semi-structured interviews with 32 participants. Three quarters of the students were placed in teams within the public sector. Among these entities, there were 11 hospitals and 12 universities. Although the majority of students did their internship as part of a methodological team, they often had a healthcare professional on their team. Nearly half of the missions involved descriptive analysis, followed by 9 missions focused on etiology or prediction and 8 missions on implementing a data warehouse. The majority of students had to perform data management and produce graphs, while only half conducted statistical analysis. The findings highlighted that data management remains a major challenge, and it should be taken into consideration when designing training programs. In future, it remains to determine whether this trend will continue with second-year students or if, with experience, they are more often assigned statistical analyses.</abstract>

      <abstract>Digital transformation and artificial intelligence are major challenges for a diversity of fields. The central and local administrations of the states need major and deep structural changes to reduce bureaucracy and public expenses, but also to significantly improve the quality of services, productivity, accessibility, and transparency of public institutions. Digitization and artificial intelligence are gradually integrated into state administrations and the governance process, and the results obtained confirm a visible increase in managerial, economic, and social efficiency. These aspects determine state governments to progressively design and implement strategies for digitalization and artificial intelligence within public services. Public investments needed for these changes are necessary for the sustainable development of the public sector. EU states are encouraged to make massive public investments to integrate artificial intelligence applications in public services and to operationalize digital transformations necessary for efficient and intelligent public administrations. © 2023, Bucharest University of Economic Studies Publishing House.

      <abstract>Driven by &#x60;success stories&#39; reported by private sector firms, government
agencies have also started adopting various Artificial Intelligence (AI)
technologies in diverse domains (e.g. health, taxation, and education);
however, extensive research is required in order to exploit the full
potential of AI in the public sector, and leverage various AI
technologies to address important problems&#x2F;needs. This paper makes a
contribution in this direction: it presents a novel approach, as well as
the architecture of an ICT platform supporting it, for the advanced
exploitation of a specific AI technology, namely chatbots, in the public
sector in order to address a crucial issue: the improvement of
communication between government and citizens (which has for long time
been problematic). The proposed approach builds on natural language
processing, machine learning and data mining technologies, and leverages
existing data of various forms (such as documents containing legislation
and directives, structured data from government agencies&#39; operational
systems, social media data, etc.), in order to develop a new digital
channel of communication between citizens and government. Making use of
appropriately structured and semantically annotated data, this channel
enables &#x60;richer&#39; and more expressive interaction of citizens with
government in everyday language, facilitating and advancing both
information seeking and conducting of transactions. Compared to existing
digital channels, the proposed approach is appropriate for a wider range
of citizens&#39; interactions, with higher levels of complexity, ambiguity
and uncertainty. In close co-operation with three Greek government
agencies (the Ministry of Finance, a social security organization, and a
big local government organization), this approach has been validated
through a series of application scenarios.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Spatial Urban Data System (SUDS) is a spatial big data infrastructure to support UK-wide analytics of the social and economic aspects of cities and city-regions. It utilises data generated from traditional as well as new and emerging sources of urban data. The SUDS deploys geospatial technology, synthetic small area urban metrics, and cloud computing to enable urban analytics, and geovisualization with the goal of deriving actionable knowledge for better urban management and data-driven urban decision making. At the core of the system is a programme of urban indicators generated by using novel forms of data and urban modelling and simulation programme. SUDS differs from other similar systems by its emphasis on the generation and use of regularly updated spatially-activated urban area metrics from real or near-real time data sources, to enhance understanding of intra-city interactions and dynamics. By deploying public transport, labour market accessibility and housing advertisement data in the system, we were able to identify spatial variations of key urban services at intra-city levels as well as social and economically-marginalised output areas in major cities across the UK. This paper discusses the design and implementation of SUDS, the challenges and limitations encountered, and considerations made during its development. The innovative approach adopted in the design of SUDS will enable it to support research and analysis of urban areas, policy and city administration, business decision-making, private sector innovation, and public engagement. Having been tested with housing, transport and employment metrics, efforts are ongoing to integrate information from other sources such as IoT, and User Generated Content into the system to enable urban predictive analytics. © 2019</abstract>

      <abstract>Flame monitoring and categorization become important in efficient power generation and energy conservation sectors. Flicker Frequency Range (FFR) is considered as the key factor to monitor flames and fuel identification. The fluctuation of combustion arises due to the varying quality of fuel, which causes the overlapping of FFR for different fuels leading to misclassification. In this work, we attempt to classify fuels based on flame characteristics output from a Digital Flame Scanner. A new model is proposed by combining Time Series Analysis with Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (TSA-FSVM) for training, classification, and prediction of fuel types. With the help of 12,000 real-time data collected from the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Tuticorin branch (a public sector company, which manufactures power plant equipment), a comparative analysis is performed using different Machine Learning algorithms with the proposed technique. From the results, it is found that TSA-FSVM outperforms existing as well as other Machine Learning methods by increasing the accuracy of predicting the right fuel. Thus, it helps to avoid the boiler system explosion&#x2F;OFF state, which leads to conserving the energy, increases electricity production, and cost-efficiency. © 2020 Curtin University and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>The purpose of this article is to identify and evaluate the limitations
and emerging trends of Six Sigma from the perspectives of Six Sigma
experts. The authors developed an online global survey and deployed the
survey to 1250 Six Sigma experts of which 307 experts responded. The
article finds integration of Six Sigma with Big Data to be the topmost
among Asian, South American, and African experts, whereas European and
North American experts felt Six Sigma in Small and Medium Sized
Enterprises and Micro-enterprises would be very beneficial. The
manufacturing sector experts nominated the topmost emerging trend as Six
Sigma in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises and Micro-enterprises to be
very challenging and will be rewarding if implemented properly. In the
service sector, the topmost emerging trend was the integration of Six
Sigma with Big Data. However, public sector experts felt variance
reduction should not be the only goal of Six Sigma implementation. The
that master black belts perceived Six Sigma in Small and Medium Sized
Enterprises and Micro-enterprises would be advantageous, whereas Black
and Green Belts perceived Integration of Six Sigma with Big Data to be
topmost emerging trend.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper we analyze the predictability of the bankruptcy of 7795 Italian municipalities in the period 2009–2016. The prediction task is extremely hard due to the small number of bankruptcy cases, on which learning is possible. Besides historical financial data for each municipality, we use alternative institutional data along with the socio-demographic and economic context. The predictability is analyzed through the performance of the statistical and machine learning models with a receiver operating characteristic curve and the precision-recall curve. Our results suggest that it is possible to make out-of-sample predictions with a high true positive rate and low false-positive rate. The model shows that some non-financial features (e.g. geographical area) are more important than many financial features to predict the default of municipalities. Among financial indicators, the important features are mainly connected to the Deficit and the Debt of Municipalities. Among the socio-demographic characteristics of administrators, the gender and the age of members in council are among the top 10 features in terms of importance for predicting municipal defaults. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study investigates the public&#39;s initial trust in so-called
&#x60;&#x60;artificial intelligence&#39;&#39; (AI) chatbots about to be introduced into
use in the public sector. While the societal impacts of AI are widely
speculated about, empirical testing remains rare. To narrow this gap,
this study builds on theories of operators&#39; trust in machines in
industrial settings and proposes that initial public trust in chatbot
responses depends on (i) the area of enquiry, since expectations about a
chatbot&#39;s performance vary with the topic, and (ii) the purposes that
governments communicate to the public for introducing the use of
chatbots. Analyses based on an experimental online survey in Japan
generated results indicating that, if a government were to announce its
intention to use &#x60;&#x60;AI&#39;&#39; chatbots to answer public enquiries, the
public&#39;s initial trust in their responses would be lower in the area of
parental support than in the area of waste separation, with a moderate
effect size. Communicating purposes that would directly benefit
citizens, such as achieving uniformity in response quality and
timeliness in responding, would enhance public trust in chatbots.
Although the effect sizes are small, communicating these purposes might
be still worthwhile, as it would be an inexpensive measure for a
government to take.</abstract>

      <abstract>Digital transaction has gained popularity among the Indian citizens after the demonetization of 2016. People have started to prefer cashless payment methods for their financial transactions and digital wallets has emerged as one of the significant tools. A digital wallet is a smart phone application provided by a service provider which enables the user to keep money and to make electronic transactions. They are an alternative version of the traditional leather wallets. The money can be loaded to the wallet from bank account by using any electronic payment methods such as internet banking, mobile banking, debit cards etc. as well as it can be transferred to other accounts as well. There are many types of transactions for which digital wallets are used such as paying utility bills, mobile recharge, fund transfer, donations, etc. This paper focuses on mining association rules on the types of transaction for which people use digital wallet the most using FP-growth algorithm. The algorithm is best suited for mining out interesting patterns from large datasets. A survey is conducted among the citizens of Kochi whose results is used as dataset for the algorithm. RapidMiner Studio is used for analyzing the data. Through our research we found that citizens of Kochi use their app the most for mobile recharging, train&#x2F;bus&#x2F;cab&#x2F;airline booking and movie ticket booking. We have also found out the results based on gender. This data can be used by both private and public sector companies in building an efficient app having a wider public approval and thus promoting cashless transactions in our country. © BEIESP.</abstract>

      <abstract>Currently, artificial intelligence is facing several problems with its practical implementation in various application domains. The explainability of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms is a topic of paramount importance, and many discussions have been held recently. Pioneering and classical machine learning and deep learning models behave as black boxes, constraining the logical interpretations that the end users desire. Artificial intelligence applications in industry, medicine, agriculture, and social sciences require the users’ trust in the systems. Users are always entitled to know why and how each method has made a decision and which factors play a critical role. Otherwise, they will always be wary of using new techniques. This paper discusses the nature of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), a soft computational method to model human knowledge and provide decisions handling uncertainty. Though FCMs are not new to the field, they are evolving and incorporate recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks. The nature of FCMs reveals their supremacy in transparency, interpretability, transferability, and other aspects of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. The present study aims to reveal and defend the explainability properties of FCMs and to highlight their successful implementation in many domains. Subsequently, the present study discusses how FCMs cope with XAI directions and presents critical examples from the literature that demonstrate their superiority. The study results demonstrate that FCMs are both in accordance with the XAI directives and have many successful applications in domains such as medical decision-support systems, precision agriculture, energy savings, environmental monitoring, and policy-making for the public sector. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The rapid evolution of technology has created new services and introduced changes to the traditional style of delivery. Organisations are trying to adapt e-services to reduce cost and enhance the quality of their e-services. The Jordanian Government has introduced an e-government model, but a major obstacle has interrupted their introduction, specifically, with its information security system (ISS). While the development of the model happened in a rapid manner, the government&#39;s implementation and management of the laws and regulations did not happen in the same speed. Hence, this study investigates and builds a security model for (ISS) for the Jordanian public sector and investigates the effect of the implementation of King Abdullah II model for excellence on public sector to build security culture and awareness, the study uses a decision tree iterative dichotomiser 3 (ID3) classifier. The study concludes that following best practice and security policy are the main factors that drive the performance of the security model. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>PurposeThis study aims to establish an assessment model to measure big
data readiness in the public sector, specifically targeting local
governments at the provincial and city&#x2F;regency levels. Additionally, the
study aims to gain valuable insights into the readiness of selected
local governments in Indonesia by using the established assessment
model.Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approachThis study uses a mixed-method
approach, using focus group discussions (FGDs), surveys and exploratory
factor analysis (EFA) to establish the assessment model. The FGDs
involve gathering perspectives on readiness variables from experts in
academia, government and practice, whereas the survey collects data from
a sample of selected local governments using a questionnaire developed
based on the variables obtained in FGDs. The EFA is used on survey data
to condense the variables into a smaller set of dimensions or factors.
Ultimately, the assessment model is applied to evaluate the level of big
data readiness among the selected Indonesian local
governments.FindingsFGDs identify 32 essential variables for evaluating
the readiness of local governments to adopt big data. Subsequently, EFA
reduces this number by five and organizes the remaining variables into
four factors: big data strategy, policy and collaboration,
infrastructure and human resources and data collection and utilization.
The application of the assessment model reveals that the overall
readiness for big data in the selected local governments is primarily
moderate, with those in the Java cluster displaying higher readiness. In
addition, the data collection and utilization factor achieves the
highest score among the four factors.Originality&#x2F;valueThis study offers
an assessment model for evaluating big data readiness within local
governments by combining perspectives from big data experts in academia,
government and practice.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big Data analytics is recognized as one of the major issues in our current information society, and raises several challenges and opportunities in many fields, including economy and finance, e-commerce, public health and administration, national security, and scientific research. The use of visualization techniques to make sense of large volumes of information is an essential ingredient, especially for the analysis of complex interrelated data, which are represented as graphs. The growing availability of powerful and inexpensive cloud computing services naturally motivates the study of distributed graph visualization algorithms, able to scale to the size of large graphs. We study the problem of designing a distributed visualization algorithm that must be simple to implement and whose computing infrastructure does not require major hardware or software investments. We design, implement, and experiment a force-directed algorithm in Giraph, a popular open source framework for distributed computing, based on a vertex-centric design paradigm. The algorithm is tested both on real and artificial graphs with up to one million edges. The experiments show the scalability and effectiveness of our technique when compared to a centralized implementation of the same force-directed model. Graphs with about one million edges can be drawn in a few minutes, by spending about 1 USD per drawing with a cloud computing infrastructure of Amazon. © 2016</abstract>

      <abstract>This research has been experimented on our previous literature review. Technological advancement has prevailed in the modern era from the 20th century. Artificial intelligence and virtual worlds have been created for rapid technological development. This paper is aimed at exploring the effect of virtual reality as a pedagogical tool for enhancing experiential learning among undergraduate students. Considering this, it was a mixed-methods study following the design of sequential exploratory-which includes qualitative followed by quantitative part. The targeted population was undergraduate students taking education programs from Public Sector Universities of Sindh. For the qualitative part, the sample of eight undergraduate students was interviewed for exploring their perceptions about virtual reality for enhancing experiential learning. The interviewed data were thematically analyzed, which revealed seven themes. For the quantitative part, emerged seven themes were used as constructs for developing the questionnaire. It was then used for quantitative data collection having excellent reliability. A sample of 80 students was taken, and data were collected by self-administration. The quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive as well as inferential statistics. Hence, the results found a statistically significant effect of virtual reality for enhancing experiential learning. However, user-friendliness ensures the applicability of virtual reality. Thus, it concluded that the implementation of virtual reality influences experiential learning enhancement. However, the implementation of virtual reality still depends upon the user-friendly nature of technology and virtual reality. © 2022 Muhammad Mujtaba Asad et al.</abstract>

      <abstract>In large-scale projects, it often occurs that the product the purchaser ends up receiving – possibly from projects extending over many years – differs from what they expected. The provider usually defends its delivered product and may blame the imprecision and ambiguity of the requirements, defined by the purchaser, as the primary reason for misinterpretation of requirements and resulting deficiencies. This letter relies on game theory to explain this problem including both intentional and unintentional misinterpretation of requirements. The letter also highlights the practical and scientific significance of the problem using two real-world cases and suggests potential tools and techniques from soft computing in order to develop decision support systems to address the problem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>

      <abstract>The paper presents an approach for implementing inscrutable (i.e.,
nonexplainable) artificial intelligence (AI) such as neural networks in
an accountable and safe manner in organizational settings. Drawing on an
exploratory case study and the recently proposed concept of envelopment,
it describes a case of an organization successfully &#x60;&#x60;enveloping&#39;&#39; its
AI solutions to balance the performance benefits of flexible AI models
with the risks that inscrutable models can entail. The authors present
several envelopment methods-establishing clear boundaries within which
the AI is to interact with its surroundings, choosing and curating the
training data well, and appropriately managing input and output
sources-alongside their influence on the choice of AI models within the
organization. This work makes two key contributions: It introduces the
concept of sociotechnical envelopment by demonstrating the ways in which
an organization&#39;s successful AI envelopment depends on the interaction
of social and technical factors, thus extending the literature&#39;s focus
beyond mere technical issues. Secondly, the empirical examples
illustrate how operationalizing a sociotechnical envelopment enables an
organization to manage the trade-off between low explainability and high
performance presented by inscrutable models. These contributions pave
the way for more responsible, accountable AI implementations in
organizations, whereby humans can gain better control of even
inscrutable machine-learning models.</abstract>

      <abstract>Smart cities assure the masses a higher quality of life through digital interconnectivity, leading to increased efficiency and accessibility in cities. In addition, a huge amount of data is being exchanged through smart devices, networks, cloud infrastructure, big data analysis and Internet of Things (IoT) applications in the various private and public sectors, such as critical infrastructures, financial sectors, healthcare, and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). However, these sectors require maintaining certain security mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of personal and critical information. However, unfortunately, organizations fail to maintain their security posture in terms of security mechanisms and controls, which leads to data breach incidents either intentionally or inadvertently due to the vulnerabilities in their information management systems that either malicious insiders or attackers exploit. In this paper, we highlight the importance of data breaches and issues related to information leakage incidents. In particular, the impact of data breaching incidents and the reasons contributing to such incidents affect the citizens’ well-being. In addition, this paper also discusses various preventive measures such as security mechanisms, laws, standards, procedures, and best practices, including follow-up mitigation strategies. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The lowest bid assignment approach is used in most infrastructure projects in the Iraqi public sector. The client announces the estimated cost of the project throughout bidding call. The successful bid depends, to a certain extent, on the contractors&#39; number sharing in the bid and ventures estimated cost. The contractor&#39;s decision to participate in the bid is based mainly on the competition&#39;s intensity and some other factors. In this paper, the bids&#39; prices of five contracting companies, which were submitted for auction in Karbala Governorate - Iraq for the period 2007-2012 were comprehensively analyzed along with the estimated cost. Non-Linear Regression (NLR) and Artificial Neural Network analysis (ANN) were employed to create prediction models. It has been concluded that the contractor can predict the number of competitors using two factors: the degree of competition and the estimated cost of the project, whereas fruitless relationship in the case of client. © 2018 IAEME Publication.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article aims to provide a comparative analysis of determining the
legal status of artificial intelligence, as well as strategic planning
of its implementation in the public sector in the countries of the
Romano-Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, socialist, religious, and traditional
systems of law. The study replies to the research questions regarding
statutory definition of AI, state authorities responsible for AI,
national government strategy in the field of AI and targets set therein,
and action plans of AI with reference to countries with the highest
Global Talent Competitiveness Index in reference to the mentioned legal
systems. The research is of qualitative and applied nature; theoretical
analysis of academic sources provides the groundwork for ICT-facilitated
thematic content analysis of legal and administrative documents of the
mentioned countries. The findings reveal common and specific trends
regarding the data under study, and allow the author to suggest a
revision of AI definition and to specify legislative and doctrinal
issues that seem to be relevant and promising in the further strategic
development and implementation of AI in the public sphere across
countries.</abstract>

      <abstract>As public sector agencies face rising imperatives to digitally transform
citizen services, data systems, and internal operations, questions
persist as to whether investments in big data analytics and automation
capabilities, evidenced to drive organizational performance in private
industry, translate to bureaucratic government contexts. This research
quantitatively investigates the link between digital capabilities and
organizational performance in the Jordanian ministry of Justice. Survey
data collected from 292 public officials assessed capabilities in
data-driven decision making, flexible automation, and interactive
constituent communications alongside organizational agility and
performance indexes spanning efficiency, quality, and satisfaction
metrics. Structural equation modeling analysis reveals that digital
capabilities relate significantly to heightened agility and all targeted
performance areas. Improved agility mediates over half the performance
impact attributable to upgraded technical systems, highlighting the
vital role of evolving digitally enabled flexibility in realizing
returns on analytics and process modernization initiatives. Findings
validate the applicability of conclusions on digitization returns formed
in corporate environments to public sector contexts, contingent on
bundled change management programming enabling both technical and
adaptive capacity building across the workforce. As global regions
expand e-governance programs premised on harnessing emerging
technologies to enhance civic institutions, this research offers
generalizable models guiding multifaceted preparations to amplify
impact.</abstract>

      <abstract>It is clear that the world of Artificial intelligence (AI) and data analysis (DA) is in a dynamic state of change. Many government agencies use predictive analytics to provide more efficient responses to community needs and are now equipped with a large amount of data. More data arrive from various sources, while citizens expect higher quality and faster service delivery at the state and local levels. This paper argues that the use of technologies such as DA, AI, algorithmic decision-making for policy-making and public administration, provides both advantages and challenges. Possible benefits include more efficient and convenient delivery of public services and better-informed policy formulation through predictive analytics, policy simulation and real-time early warning systems. The challenges include the autonomy of citizens and officials, the accountability of the algorithmic system and privacy. We believe that the future requires a balanced approach where innovation is combined with ethical data practices. However, by strengthening governance, adopting committed leadership, focusing on talent recruitment and development, and implementing new management practices, governments can continue to scale up the use of predictive analytics. © 2024 Science of Law.</abstract>

      <abstract>Open government data, as open data, are published to let interested stakeholders exploit data and create value out of them, but limited technical skills are a crucial barrier. Moreover, data silos within any public agency behave as a further obstacle in enabling collaboration between different working groups. This paper investigates the acceptance level of a collaborative platform to co-create, analyze, and visualize open government data within an Italian Regional Public Administration—the Campania region. This investigation first requires retracing and documenting the organizational changes applied to the Campania Region in moving from a siloed structure to a more horizontal and collaborative one. Second, it introduces the technical and technological contribution provided by the proposal of a Social Platform on Open Data (SPOD) as a regional public administration back-office, i.e., an internal platform, co-designed with public agency delegates and referred to as Campania Crea. Finally, it reports on the training session moderated by the University of Salerno to evaluate the acceptance rate of the proposed platform in real settings by involving 54 public agency members in actively using Campania Crea to co-create, analyze, and visualize open government data. The After Scenario Questionnaire was used to assess the acceptance level and attitude in using Campania Crea to report task-based results and the Technology Acceptance Model as an overall assessment of the platform acceptance level. As a result, Campania Crea supports regional public administration members in accomplishing their daily tasks concerning co-creation, analysis, and visualization of open data who positively accepted Campania Crea as a back-office tool. However, further effort should be invested in raising awareness and developing skills concerning open government data management. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The field of electronic government (e-government) is gaining prominence in contemporary society, as it has a significant influence on the wider populace within the context of a technologically advanced world. E-government makes use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) at various levels and domains within government agencies and the public sector. ICT reduces manual labour, potential fraud points, errors, and process lapses. The Internet’s quick accessibility and the widespread adoption of modern technologies and disciplines, such as big data, the Internet of Things, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, have accelerated the need for e-government. However, these developments raise a number of data reliability and precision concerns. The adoption of blockchain technology by researchers demonstrates its efficacy in addressing such issues. The present study proposes the SECHash system model, which integrates blockchain and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies for the purpose of regulating the processing of incoming documents by governmental agencies. As a case study to assess the proposed system paradigm, the study uses a document containing incoming invoices. The proposal seeks to maintain the integrity of document data by prohibiting its modification after acceptance. Additionally, SECHash guarantees that accepted documents will not be destroyed or lost. The analysis demonstrates that using the SECHash model system will decrease fraudulent transactions by eradicating manual labour and storing documents on a blockchain network. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Internet of Things is emerging as an incredible future technology to improve the existing lifestyle from the research community, industry, and the public sector. The main intention of IoT is to create an efficient, interactive, and autonomous infrastructure for a safer and healthier world. Moreover, it grows faster day-to-day with the support of many other technologies, i.e. Cloud computing, Blockchain, Wireless Body Sensor Networks, Nanotechnology, and Artificial Intelligence for smart applications, including healthcare, environment, automotive industries, transportation, agriculture, etc. Nevertheless, managing big data is one of the challenging tasks due to the increased number of devices leading to various serious issues like security, privacy, accuracy, latency, scheduling, etc. Further, specific infrastructures with remarkable techniques are required to analyze the bulk of raw data to progress the quality of life and allow timely intervention through various capabilities, i.e., data capture, unique identification, actuation, communication, data mining, etc. In past literature, numerous reviews&#x2F;surveys are presented that explore the technologies mentioned above as standalone and application specific. However, this paper aims to integrate all the mentioned technologies and deliver a clear vision to future researchers (newcomers) as a kick-start article to boost up and understand the status of the existing research through a comprehensive review of the Internet of Things and its evolution in wireless telecommunications from a general perspective. The most significant challenges and issues are highlighted to research further in these evolving domains. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Present study aims to investigate the implications of COVID-19 on the learning satisfaction of engineering students. In this regard, data were collected from 623 students living in the urban&#x2F;rural areas and studying in the public&#x2F;private universities of a developing country. Authenticity of the data was checked with the help of KMO (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin) and Bartlett tests, while descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and multiple regression were used for data analysis. The results indicated an asymmetrical pattern, as the students living in urban areas and studying in private universities expressed the highest level of satisfaction (84.6%), while the students living in rural areas and studying in public sector universities expressed the lowest satisfaction scores (54.1%). It was observed that home learning conditions, availability of suitable computing devices, quality of internet services, and instructional methodology had the greatest impact on student learning satisfaction. Afterwards, structured interviews were conducted with the concerned stakeholders to develop a remedial framework for the guidance of universities. Although, the focus of the study was engineering students, yet the insights of the paper are quite generic and can be applied to other educational fields as well. © 2021 TEMPUS Publications.</abstract>

      <abstract>One of the primary tools for monitoring human movement and to prevent unwanted or unintended activities is surveillance camera. Nowadays, security management professional rely heavily on video surveillance to challenge crime and avert negative incidents that impact human society. Large numbers of surveillance camera installations have been increasing dramatically in the private and public sectors to monitor public activities. Video surveillance is one of the most effective methods to guarantee security. Fitting a surveillance camera simply transfers the captured video to security personnel. But the abnormal activities can be identified only by integrating an intelligent system to analyze the videos. Hence, this paper is motivated to design and implement an Intelligent Video Analytics Model (IVAM) also known as Human Object Detection (HOD) method for analyzing and detecting video-based abundant objects and abnormal human activities. IVAM can be deployed along with surveillance cameras in any public places like airport, hospital, shopping malls and railway station to automatically identify any abnormal event. IVAM is experimented with MATLAB software and the results are verified. The performance of IVAM is evaluated by comparing the obtained results with the existing approaches and it is proved that IVAM performs better compared to other contemporary methods in terms of accurately detecting the anomalies with less error rate and high classification accuracy. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>This work presents the practical design of a system that faces the problem of identification and validation of private no-parking road signs. This issue is very important for the public city administrations since many people, after receiving a code that identifies the signal at the entrance of their private car garage as valid, forget to renew the code validity through the payment of a city tax, causing large money shortages to the public administration. The goal of the system is twice since, after recognition of the official road sign pattern, its validity must be controlled by extracting the code put in a specific sub-region inside it. Despite a lot of work on the road signs’ topic having been carried out, a complete benchmark dataset also considering the particular setting of the Italian law is today not available for comparison, thus the second goal of this work is to provide experimental results that exploit machine learning and deep learning techniques that can be satisfactorily used in industrial applications. © 2018 by the authors.

      <abstract>Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are established to specifically harness the potential of Big Data in healthcare and can include partners working across the data chain—producing health data, analysing data, using research results or creating value from data. This domain paper will illustrate the challenges that arise when partners from the public and private sector collaborate to share, analyse and use biomedical Big Data. We discuss three specific challenges for PPPs: working within the social licence, public antipathy to the commercialisation of public sector health data, and questions of ownership, both of the data and any resulting intellectual property or products. As a specific example we consider the case of the UK National Health Service (NHS) providing patient data to Google’s DeepMind AI program to develop a diagnostic app for kidney disease. This article is an application of the framework presented in this issue of ABR (Xafis et al. 2019). Please refer to that article for more information on how this framework is to be used, including a full explanation of the key values involved and the balancing approach used in the case study at the end. We use four specific values to help analysis these issues: public benefit, stewardship, transparency and engagement. We demonstrate how the Deliberative Framework can support ethical governance of PPPs involving biomedical big data. © 2019, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>&#x60;&#x60;We have all this data, why don&#39;t we use it?&#39;&#39; This question seems to
be a constant in performance literature. Although the uptake in
performance management throughout the public sector has been pronounced
in recent decades, particularly among public health departments, both
empirical and anecdotal evidence suggest that few organizations have
gone beyond simply collecting and reporting performance data to actually
integrating these data into their decision-making processes. One barrier
to such integration may be the lack of visual accessibility in
performance data reports. Research in other fields has provided strong
evidence suggesting that visualizing data, rather than providing simply
numerical displays, promotes data cognition and use. This study employs
an experimental survey vignette design to test whether graphically
displayed performance information results in higher intended rates of
performance information use among public health managers. The results
suggest that in some instances, specifically ratio indicators and
benchmarking reporting, data visualization increases the intention of
public managers to use that information for decision making. This study
provides both practical approaches to promoting performance-data
utilizing as well as opening new avenues to performance research around
data value and cognition.</abstract>

      <abstract>Tutoring programs are effective in reducing school failures among at-risk students. However, there is still room for improvement in maximising the social returns they provide on investments. Many factors and components can affect student engagement in a program and academic success. This complexity presents a challenge for Public Administrations to use their budgets as efficiently as possible. Our research focuses on providing public administration with advanced decision-making tools. First, we analyse a database with information on 2066 students of the Programa para la Mejora de Éxito Educativo (Programme for the Improvement of Academic Success) of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla y Léon in Spain, in 2018–2019, the academic year previous to the pandemic. This program is designed to help schools with students at risk of failure in Spanish, literature, mathematics, and English. We developed a machine learning model (ML) based on Kohonen self-organising maps (SOMs), which are a type of unsupervised (ANN), to group students based on their characteristics, the type of tutoring program in which they were enrolled, and their results in both the completion of the program and the 4th year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO). Second, we evaluated the results of tutoring programs and identified and explained how different factors and components affect student engagement and academic success. Our findings provide Public Administrations with better decision-making tools to evaluate and measure the results of tutoring programs in terms of social return on investment, improve the design of these programs, and choose the students to enrol. © 2023 The Author(s)</abstract>

      <abstract>This research aims to demonstrate the need for an economic evaluation of the Organic Law that modifies the Organic Law of Education (LOMLOE), especially after the investment of EU Next Generation funds that open new opportunities that were lacking in the initial drafting of the law. The challenge for Public Administrations is to use this addi-tional investment efficiently. Our analysis shows that artificial intelligence models can predict whether educational support programmes will help increase the like-lihood that students who lag behind will pass the 4th grade of ESO (Compulsory Secondary Education). In this way, we can calculate the social return of one of these programmes and contribute to their ex-ante design to achieve higher success rates for students. To complement the models already used by Public Administrations, we use robust Machine Learning (ML) models such as CHAID decision trees and artificial neural networks to analyse the characteristics of the groups of students and the interven-tion they have been part of. The conclusions allow us to improve educational reinforce-ment programmes in the coming years to support students with lower chances of ac-ademic success. © 2022, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

      <abstract>The evaluation of the impact of the adoption of industrial robotics on business is increasingly relevant in the current context of digital transformation. Although many companies are eager to adopt these technologies as a means to increase productivity, some concerns have been raised about the cost impact of the transformation, and its effect on the workforce. A growing body of literature is studying these phenomena but according to our review of it, there is no longitudinal perspective over 25 years illustrating the relationship between the attitude of companies to robotics and principal business indicators. This investigation uses an innovative machine learning model comprising an automated nested longitudinal clustering performed in two stages, and it is applied over a large sample of 4,578 companies from the Business Strategy Survey conducted by the Spanish Ministry of Finance and Public Administration. The findings of this research are novel in this field not only because of the longitudinal modelling applied in two stages but also because of the understanding of how companies’ characteristics and performance evolve over time depending on their degree of adoption of robotics. This knowledge is relevant for companies to understand the impact of their transformation to robotics. It also allows for the development of strategies that boost the efficiency of the companies, provides them with tools to protect them from negative financial events, and leads to an optimal sizing of their workforce. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>

      <abstract>Federated Learning (FL) has been foundational in improving the performance of a wide range of applications since it was first introduced by Google. Some of the most prominent and commonly used FL-powered applications are Android&#39;s Gboard for predictive text and Google Assistant. FL can be defined as a setting that makes on-device, collaborative Machine Learning possible. A wide range of literature has studied FL technical considerations, frameworks, and limitations with several works presenting a survey of the prominent literature on FL. However, prior surveys have focused on technical considerations and challenges of FL, and there has been a limitation in more recent work that presents a comprehensive overview of the status and future trends of FL in applications and markets. In this survey, we introduce the basic fundamentals of FL, describing its underlying technologies, architectures, system challenges, and privacy-preserving methods. More importantly, the contribution of this work is in scoping a wide variety of FL current applications and future trends in technology and markets today. We present a classification and clustering of literature progress in FL in application to technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, Natural Language Processing, autonomous vehicles, and resource allocation, as well as in application to market use cases in domains of Data Science, healthcare, education, and industry. We discuss future open directions and challenges in FL within recommendation engines, autonomous vehicles, IoT, battery management, privacy, fairness, personalization, and the role of FL for governments and public sectors. By presenting a comprehensive review of the status and prospects of FL, this work serves as a reference point for researchers and practitioners to explore FL applications under a wide range of domains. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Algorithmic decision-making is neither a recent phenomenon nor one
necessarily associated with artificial intelligence (AI), though
advances in AI are increasingly resulting in what were heretofore human
decisions being taken over by, or becoming dependent on, algorithms and
technologies like machine learning. Such developments promise many
potential benefits, but are not without certain risks. These risks are
not always well understood. It is not just a question of machines making
mistakes; it is the embedding of values, biases and prejudices in
software which can discriminate against both individuals and groups in
society. Such biases are often hard either to detect or prove,
particularly where there are problems with transparency and
accountability and where such systems are outsourced to the private
sector. Consequently, being able to detect and categorise these risks is
essential in order to develop a systematic and calibrated response. This
paper proposes a simple taxonomy of decision-making algorithms in the
public sector and uses this to build a risk management framework with a
number of components including an accountability structure and
regulatory governance. This framework is designed to assist scholars and
practitioners interested in ensuring structured accountability and legal
regulation of AI in the public sphere.</abstract>

      <abstract>In terms of technological progress, students of public administration
confront a challenging dilemma where normative reflection in the realm
of technology ethics has not kept pace with the rapidity and magnitude
of technological advancement. Consequently, this necessitates further
reflection on how to best apply aspects of ethical behavior to the
development and usage of technology in the public sector. The
significant role of the technology ethics in public service has received
meager consideration in the literature, lacking a theoretical foundation
that can help guide practitioners (as techno-ethicists) through rapid
transitions in technological progress. Using the philosophy of
technology literature, this article seeks to address this gap in public
administration theory by considering first, how technological
advancements affect the nature of didactic power relationships between
the public and government; and second how the concept of technological
nonneutrality is framed as a basis for structuring what obligations
public administrators have when adopting and using technology in public
service. This includes reflection upon the expanding role of newer
technologies such as Artificial Intelligence in reshaping the nature of
government-society relationships. Framing techno-ethical principles in
theoretical dialogue prompts greater awareness for how practitioners may
effectively respond as moral agents to rapidly changing technological
advancements.</abstract>

      <abstract>The construction of urban and transport indicators aims for a better
diagnosis that enables technical and precise decision-making for the
public administration or private investment. Therefore, it is common to
make comparisons and observe which has better diagnosis results in a
diversity of indexes and models. The present study made a comparative
analysis of spatial models using artificial intelligence to estimate
transport demand. To achieve this goal, the audit field was recollected
in specific urban corridors to measure the indicators. A study case in
Queretaro, an emergent city in the Mexican region known as El Bajio, is
conducted. Two similar urban avenues in width and length and close to
each other were selected to apply a group of spatial models, evaluating
the avenues by segments and predicting the public transport demand. The
resulting database was analyzed using Artificial Neural Networks. It
displays specific indicators that have around 80% of correlations. The
results facilitate the localization of the avenue segments with the most
volume of activity, supporting interventions in urban renewal and
sustainable transportation projects.</abstract>

      <abstract>Estimates of resident satisfaction with public education have great utility in public administration, especially among decision makers in shrinking small communities. But such estimates are typically obtained via surveys, which are costly and often unreliable at high spatial resolutions given low response rates. Our study found that satisfaction with public schools among residents of small communities can be reasonably estimated at the community level using public data. Several models generalized adequately to unseen data—these models typically included the following covariates: state student assessment scores, school reorganizations, net open enrollment, and the cost of educational outcomes relative to neighboring districts. Our findings thus amount to a cost-effective survey alternative for gauging satisfaction with public schools in small Iowa communities. © 2022 The Authors.

      <abstract>Transparency, participation, and collaboration are the core pillars of open government. For the systematic integration of citizens and other stakeholders into the policy and public value creation process, their opinions, wishes, and complaints first need to be received. In the future, including user-generated content from social media will become a main channel for the enrichment of this information base for public administrative bodies and commercial firms. However, the sheer speed of growth of this constantly updated data pool makes manual work infeasible. The automated gathering, combination, analysis, and visualization of user-generated content from various sources and multiple languages is therefore imperative. In this study, we present a design science research approach to develop a general framework (‘MarketMiner’) to handle large amounts of foreign-language user-generated content. As a first empirical application, we implement the framework in the automotive industry by analyzing Chinese automotive forums for the benefit of English-speaking users. At the same time, the ideas, methods, and insights are transferred to the public sector context, especially in light of the current challenges of a high number of political refugees from Arabic countries entering into the European Union. The results are promising in that MarketMiner can dramatically improve the utilization of multi-language, multi-source social media content. The modular set-up of the artifact allows an easy transfer to additional areas of application. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</abstract>

      <abstract>The public buildings sector represents one of the most intensive items of EU energy consumption; the application of retrofit solutions in existing buildings is a crucial way to reduce its impact. To facilitate the knowledge of the energy performance of existing non-residential buildings and the choice of the more adequate actions, Public Administrations (PA) should have the availability of proper tools. Within the Italian project “POI 2007-13”, a database and a decision support tool, for easy use, even to a non-technical user, have been developed. A large set of data, obtained from the energy audits of 151 existing public buildings located in four regions of South Italy have been analysed, elaborated, and organised in a database. This was used to identify the best architectures of two ANNs and to train them. The first ANN provides the actual energy performance of any building; the second ANN assesses key economic indicators. A decision support tool, based on the use of these ANNs is conceived for a fast prediction of the energy performance of buildings and for a first selection of energy retrofit actions that can be applied. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured&#x2F;semi-structured machine-readable documents. Among various IE tasks, extracting actionable intelligence from an ever-increasing amount of data depends critically upon cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) - the task of identifying entity mentions across information sources that refer to the same underlying entity. CDCR is the basis of knowledge acquisition and is at the heart of Web search, recommendations, and analytics. Real time processing of CDCR processes is very important and have various applications in discovering must-know information in real-time for clients in finance, public sector, news, and crisis management. Being an emerging area of research and practice, the reported literature on CDCR challenges and solutions is growing fast but is scattered due to the large space, various applications, and large datasets of the order of peta-&#x2F;tera-bytes. In order to fill this gap, we provide a systematic review of the state of the art of challenges and solutions for a CDCR process. We identify a set of quality attributes, that have been frequently reported in the context of CDCR processes, to be used as a guide to identify important and outstanding issues for further investigations. Finally, we assess existing tools and techniques for CDCR subtasks and provide guidance on selection of tools and algorithms. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.</abstract>

      <abstract>Violence has immediate and long-term repercussions for the health of individuals and communities. Recent increases in the understanding of public health approaches to violence prevention have focused on the policies and practices of government, health, and other public sector agencies. However, the roles of commercial bodies in fostering and preventing violence remain largely unaddressed. The wealth and influence of some companies now exceeds that of many countries. Consequently, it is timely to explore the roles of commercial processes in violence. Using a conceptual framework for the commercial determinants of health, we examine seven practices: political; scientific; marketing; supply chain and waste; labor and employment; financial; and reputational management. We include areas directly linked with violence (e.g., firearms) and those that indirectly impact violence through the following: design and promotion of products; employment practices; and impacts on environment, poverty, and local resources. A range of avoidable commercial behaviors are found to increase levels of violence including the following: lobbying practices; distortion of scientific processes; polluting manufacture and supply lines; poor employee protections; financial investment in organizations and regimes associated with violence; and misleading communications and marketing. We conclude commercial actors can take action to ensure their workers, clients, suppliers, and distributors help prevent, not promote, violence. New technologies such as artificial intelligence are transforming corporate processes and products and offer opportunities to implement violence prevention through commercial developments (e.g., monitoring online content). International regulation of commercial behaviors is needed to prevent interpersonal and interstate conflict and harms to health and trade. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: This article aims to provide a bibliometric and systematic literature analysis of studies published in the Journal of Intellectual Capital (JIC) from 2014 to 2018 in order to highlight emerging themes and future trends. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: The analysis focused on 187 papers published on JIC over a period of five years. A scientometric approach to data mining enabled the detection of patterns in the dataset. Precisely, the investigation was conducted by integrating a bibliometric analysis on VOSviewer with a systematic literature review. Findings: Four main streams of research on JIC emerged in the years of the analysis: reporting and disclosure of intellectual capital; intellectual capital research in universities, education and public sector; knowledge management; intellectual capital, financial performance, and market value. Research limitations&#x2F;implications: The study offers valid insights to the topics covered by the Journal of Intellectual Capital by identifying the main research gaps and trends, along with future research avenues. Originality&#x2F;value: Prior scholars mostly focused on systematic literature reviews, whilst the use of bibliometric methods generally seems to be a missing tile in the research domain. Also, none of the extant studies has focused on the Journal of Intellectual Capital with reference to the 2014–2018 period. The use of both bibliometric and systematic approaches to literature review delivered extremely fine-tuned results in terms of factors such as citations, contents and evolution of clusters over time. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>The study examines the issue of digitalisation of public administration. After outlining the theoretical foundations, an international framework for the creation of digital public administration is analyzed, followed by a discussion of its development in Hungary and its evaluation. In Hungary, the related legislation was initially introduced with the implementation of electronic administration, the anomalies of which were first noticeable with the introduction of electronic birth registration. In this context, the study discusses the possibilities of applying artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector and reviews current and existing applications and good solutions, as well as possible development directions. The article describes the successes of AI applications in the financial sector and then goes on to discuss automated decision-making in more detail, as well as the planned legislative thinking on the subject. © 2024, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Sklodowskiej w Lublinie.

      <abstract>This paper focuses on the right to an effective remedy in the public sector when algorithms are used to support decision-making processes. More particularly, the focus will be on how the effectiveness of judicial review can be ensured in such contexts. This paper questions whether effective judicial review is possible where recommender systems are deployed in a multi-governance system such as the EU administrative space. Since assessing the effectiveness of judicial review requires a case-by-case analysis, the possible deployment of recommender systems in the EU administrative space, regarding informational cooperation, will serve as a case study. Today, informational cooperation understood in the context of composite procedures is widely used and has evolved from information requests, from one national administration to another, to shared databases and IT systems used as platforms to exchange information. It is assumed hereafter that the next evolution to these databases and IT systems is the deployment of recommender systems. If these recommender systems are starting to be deployed, compliance of their use with the procedural dimension of the rule of law and, more particularly, the right to an effective remedy must be complied with. © 2023 The Author(s).</abstract>

decision-making and the exercise of discretion in Australian taxation
law in the context of the development of digital government and the
increasing use of artificial intelligence. The article proposes a
framework for the exercise of discretion by the Australian Taxation
Office (ATO) in decision-making involving expert systems and emerging
supervised machine learning and deep learning, consistent with
administrative law. The framework is of wider relevance to public sector
delegated decision-making and it draws on relevant principles and case

      <abstract>This paper investigates the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
in the Swedish Public Employment Service (PES), focusing on the concept
of trustworthy AI in public decision -making. Despite Sweden&#39;s advanced
digitalization efforts and the widespread application of AI in the
public sector, our study reveals significant gaps between theoretical
ambitions and practical outcomes, particularly in the context of AI&#39;s
trustworthiness. We employ a robust theoretical framework comprising
Institutional Theory, the Resource -Based View (RBV), and Ambidexterity
Theory, to analyze the challenges and discrepancies in AI implementation
within PES. Our analysis shows that while AI promises enhanced decision
-making efficiency, the reality is marred by issues of transparency,
interpretability, and stakeholder engagement. The opacity of the neural
network used by the agency to assess jobseekers&#39; need for support and
the lack of comprehensive technical understanding among PES management
contribute to the challenges in achieving transparent and interpretable
AI systems. Economic pressures for efficiency often overshadow the need
for ethical considerations and stakeholder involvement, leading to
decisions that may not be in the best interest of jobseekers. We propose
recommendations for enhancing AI&#39;s trustworthiness in public services,
emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, particularly
involving jobseekers in the decision -making process. Our study
advocates for a more nuanced balance between the use of advanced AI
technologies and the leveraging of internal resources such as skilled
personnel and organizational knowledge. We also highlight the need for
improved AI literacy among both management and personnel to effectively
navigate AI&#39;s integration into public decision -making processes. Our
findings contribute to the ongoing debate on trustworthy AI, offering a
detailed case study that bridges the gap between theoretical exploration
and practical application. By scrutinizing the AI implementation in the
Swedish PES, we provide valuable insights and guidelines for other
public sector organizations grappling with the integration of AI into
their decision -making processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>With the advancement of technology, digitalization, and the internet of things, large amounts of complex data are being produced daily. This vast quantity of various data produced at high speed is referred to as Big Data. The utilization of Big Data is being implemented with success in the private sector, yet the public sector seems to be falling behind despite the many potentials Big Data has already presented. In this regard, this paper explores ways in which the government can recognize the use of Big Data for official statistics. It begins by gathering and presenting Big Data-related initiatives and projects across the globe for various types and sources of Big Data implemented. Further, this paper discusses the opportunities, challenges, and risks associated with using Big Data, particularly in official statistics. This paper also aims to assess the current utilization of Big Data in the country through focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Based on desk review, discussions, and interviews, the paper then concludes with a proposed framework that provides ways in which Big Data may be utilized by the government to augment official statistics.  © 2021 - IOS Press.

      <abstract>This paper is an attempt to build constructive rapport in L2 classroom to provide enhanced opportunities and optimum conditions for improvement in learners&#39; L2 proficiency and classroom performance. Previous studies have supported the theory that teachers and peers offer unique learning opportunities as partners in interaction (Philips, Adams &amp; Iwashita, 2013). Therefore, a good rapport is essential between the teacher and learners, but the same amongst the peers also positively impact learning outcomes. This study limits itself to learner-learner connection in L2 learning, the importance of which has become all the more poignant in these times of distance and online learning. Through random sampling, a total of 209 participants were selected for this study from two out of the three prominent public sector universities in Jamshoro, Sindh: UoSJ and MUET. The data was analyzed quantitatively to measure the correlation between learner-learner rapport and second language learning proficiency. Findings confirmed that the association between variables was not linear, so Kendall&#39;s tau-b correlation coefficient, a nonparametric test, was applied. The study findings clearly show the excellent constructive association between learner-learner rapport and second language learning. © 2020 Asian E F L Journal Press. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: Various monitoring approaches have shown that urban areas and their energy systems are major contributors to climate change. Corresponding observations have mostly been based on physical data. However, text data is an untapped source of information that can be analyzed by text mining methods. Taking the example of the German Energy Transition, an interpretation network analysis was used to assess local transition patterns in 16 municipal climate action plans of regional centers in the State of Lower Saxony. Based on the holistic concept of social-ecological systems, three analytical perspectives were introduced, the social system, the energy system, and the three principles of strong sustainability, which inspired three questions: What is the “horizon of attention” regarding the stages of the energy system? What potential, in terms of coordination or collaboration, can be identified on basis of network links between societal sub-systems and the energy system? Are strong sustainability principles adequately linked to the energy system to support a transition towards sustainability? Methods: A computer-aided interpretation network analysis was used. The (co-)occurrence of indicative words representing pre-defined categories was checked in the measures proposed in the plans to analyze the importance and connectedness of these categories. For this purpose, three thesauri were created as fixed literature-based categorization schemes. Results: Municipalities had a nuanced understanding of climate protection focusing on energy conversion and end-use. Public administrations were closely connected role models, economic stakeholders seemed only partly interlinked. The plans referred to all three sustainability principles. However, their implementation might not fully acknowledge the ecological carrying capacity, because, e.g., the strategy of setting limits could not be clearly identified. Conclusions: To advance municipal climate protection, current cross-sectoral multilevel governance approaches should be improved with emphasis on capacity of local administrations, electricity grids, or renewables in the sectors heat and mobility. Also, more emphasis on sustainability communication and education based on all three sustainability principles will be crucial for a transition towards sustainability. From a methodological viewpoint, the text mining approach could confirm and complement recent studies. Considering its limitations and prospects, it can be advanced to useful tool sets for semantic sustainability assessments. © 2017, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>Understanding how climate change adaptation is integrated into existing
policy sectors and organizations is critical to ensure timely and
effective climate actions across multiple levels and scales. Studying
climate change adaptation policy has become increasingly difficult,
particularly given the increasing volume of potentially relevant data
available, the validity of existing methods handling large volumes of
data, and comprehensiveness of assessing processes of integration across
all sectors and public sector organizations over time. This article
explores the use of machine learning to assist researchers when
conducting adaptation policy research using text as data. We briefly
introduce machine learning for text analysis, present the steps of
training and testing a neural network model to classify policy texts
using data from the UK, and demonstrate its usefulness with quantitative
and qualitative illustrations. We conclude the article by reflecting on
the merits and pitfalls of using machine learning in our case study and
in general for researching climate change adaptation policy.</abstract>

      <abstract>Reducing the energy consumption of buildings in the public sector is an important component in our efforts towards reaching our sustainability goals. In this context, a decisive prerequisite for administrations and policy makers is a tool for estimating the effectiveness of measures to reduce energy consumption. Estimating the impact of planned investments in building technology at scale, however, remains challenging, mainly for two reasons. For one, accurate physical modeling requires detailed building data, which can be difficult to obtain. Second, adapting established building models to novel measures aiming at energy consumption reduction is difficult. Hence, modeling building consumption patterns after retrofitting is a non-trivial task, and more research is needed to improve modeling techniques as well as to assess their effectiveness across a wide range of application scenarios. Modeling tools need to be generic enough to enable modeling of a variety of building types, they should ideally require as few input features as possible and they should allow for a high degree of automation in the selection and calibration of building modeling tools. Here, we propose a novel machine learning approach that does not require detailed building data and can automatically adapt to retrofitting measures. We evaluate our method on a data set of 113 public buildings in 4 building categories in Berlin, Germany. The data set contains energy consumption data in the initial state and after implementation of a weather-predictive heating control system. Despite being fully automated and requiring only minimal information about the building, our model can reliably predict the energy consumption of large public buildings better than established methods. All code and data are publicly released. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this article, the authors propose a new approach to automate the analysis of the political discourse of the citizens and public servants, to allow public administrations to better react to their needs and claims. The tool presented in this article can be applied to the analysis of the underlying political themes in any type of text, in order to better understand the reasons behind it. To do so, the authors have built a discourse classifier using multi-scale convolutional neural networks in seven different languages: Spanish, Finnish, Danish, English, German, French, and Italian. Each of the language-specific discourse classifiers has been trained with sentences extracted from annotated parties’ election manifestos. The analysis proves that enhancing the multi-scale convolutional neural networks with context data improves the political analysis results. © The Author(s) 2018.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study aims to analyze the state of the art in the use of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in Brazilian public account control bodies, in all
their spheres, whether federal, state or muni-cipal, pointing out the
results, costs and costs benefits of these machines. The relevance of
this theme is due to the continuous use of this technology by the
Brazilian Public Administration and its consequences for the high
demands of the Courts of Accounts. The research problem is: What AI
mechanisms are being used by the Brazilian Courts of Au-ditors and if,
based on the data released by the Public Ad-ministration, it is possible
to map the costs and benefits of using such technologies within the
Public Administration? In order to answer the problem, it was decided to
divide the development into three parts. At first, the idea is to
unders-tand the role of the Court of Auditors in controlling public
accounts; in a second, to map the use of AI within the sco-pe of the
Courts of Accounts, pointing out which activities are used, in addition
to reflections on the potential of AI by the control bodies; and,
finally, build a table demonstrating the state of the art of AI in
Brazilian public account control bodies. The hypothesis is that it is
possible to point out a diagnosis based on the research carried out with
the Brazi-lian Courts of Auditors and, still in a preliminary way, it is
possible to identify the benefits for the control of the Digital Public
Administration.The methodology used is a bibliogra-phic and exploratory
study of government documents. The approach is quantitative and
qualitative and the research is descriptive based on government
documents and scientific articles. It was concluded that AI brought
several changes to control bodies, mainly in relation to repetitive
demands, that is, it has been a way of enacting irregularities for a
more predictive function and less decision-making, at least in part.
However, it is still possible to evolve so that the robot is present in
decision-making bodies.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article aims to explain the connection between Artificial
Intelligence, its possible uses in Public Administration, the increase
in efficiency, and the right to development. The importance of this
study arises from the exponential speed of technological advances, the
inseparability of technology to contemporary society and the systemic
impacts it provokes. From these premises, we intend to help build an
investigation agenda about the aspects and effects about which the
encounter between Artificial Intelligence and the Public Administration
should arouse care, in relation to the risks and human biases that may
cause undesired or discriminatory results. The text adopts a
deductive-descriptive methodology, guided by the following question: in
what way can the application of Artificial Intelligence instrumentalize
the Public Administration to foster efficiency and the right to
sustainable development? Consigns that the implementation of
technologies is an imperative derived from the principles of efficiency
and actuality, both of which are corollaries of the Republic&#39;s
fundamental objective of national development. Concludes considering
that the association of machine learning and deep learning modeling,
plus human contribution, ensures the benefits of distinct natural and
artificial abilities and has the potential to produce advantageous
socioeconomic results.</abstract>

      <abstract>Emerging technologies permeate and potentially disrupt a wide spectrum
of our social, economic, and political relations. Various state
institutions, including education, law enforcement, and healthcare,
increasingly rely on technical components, such as automated
decision-making systems, e-government systems, and other digital tools
to provide cheap, efficient public services, and supposedly fair,
transparent, disinterested, and accountable public administration. The
increased interest in various blockchain-based solutions from central
bank digital currencies, via tokenized educational credentials, and
distributed ledger-based land registries to self-sovereign identities is
the latest, still mostly unwritten chapter in a long history of
standardized, objectified, automated, technocratic, and technologized
public administration. The rapid, (often) unplanned, and uncontrolled
technologization of public services (as happened in the hasty adoption
of distance-learning and teleconferencing systems during Corona Virus
Disease (COVID) lockdowns) raises complex questions about the use of
novel technological components, which may or may not be ultimately
adequate for the task for which they are used. The question whether we
can trust the technical infrastructures the public sector uses when
providing public services is a central concern in an age where trust in
government is declining: If the government&#39;s artificial intelligence
system that detects welfare fraud fails, the public&#39;s confidence in the
government is ultimately hit. In this paper, we provide a critical
assessment of how the use of potentially untrustworthy (private)
technological systems including blockchain-based systems in the public
sector may affect trust in government. We then propose several policy
options to protect the trust in government even if some of their
technological components prove fundamentally untrustworthy.</abstract>

      <abstract>Educational process mining (EPM) is an emerging field in educational data mining (EDM) aiming to make unexpressed knowledge explicit and to facilitate better understanding of the educational process. EPM uses log data gathered specifically from educational environments in order to discover, analyze, and provide a visual representation of the complete educational process. This paper introduces EPM and elaborates on some of the potential of this technology in the educational domain. It also describes some other relevant, related areas such as intentional mining, sequential pattern mining and graph mining. It highlights the components of an EPM framework and it describes the different challenges when handling event logs and other generic issues. It describes the data, tools, techniques and models used in EPM. In addition, the main work in this area is described and grouped by educational application domains.

      <abstract>As the world is becoming more digital, private companies are now using cutting-edge technologies to streamline their operations and increase public trust. In countries like Pakistan, where the government is in charge of most public services, technological adoption is premature for a number of reasons. This study identified the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in five different management components, such as demand management, procurement management, logistics management, disposal management, and risk management which contribute to enhancing overall supply chain management performance in the public sector. Research found that bureaucracy is the crucial adoption barrier that existed in Pakistan’s public distribution systems, with AI being the most popular technology. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Regulatory technology (RegTech) has its origins in private sector applications of information technology in pursuit of more efficient compliance with government regulations. Initially, the term “RegTech” referred to either the technical solutions intended to aid financial service providers in managing regulatory issues or to the companies and organizations that develop and deliver such solutions. Increasingly, regulatory experts are stretching the term’s coverage to include efforts by governments to harness technical solutions in pursuit of more efficient targeting and conduct of regulatory monitoring and enforcement. Whether deployed within the private or public sectors, RegTech holds significant potential to improve regulatory compliance, reduce compliance costs, and improve the speed and accuracy with which known harms can be addressed and emerging risks can be identified. Here, we focus on the potential for RegTech to support the creation of public value. We suggest public value is most likely to be realized when governments (1) keep focused on regulatory purpose and effective design and (2) build effective collaboration with RegTech providers and regulated entities. © 2023 The Author(s).

      <abstract>This paper is a proposition of methodological and technological approaches that try to constitute a framework that introduces modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for decision-making in the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage (CH) processes. The research aims to accelerate and improve the quality of adaptive CH re-use. The complexity of the problem derives from some causes of different nature: lack of attention to this problem from the public administration and private investors; decision-making processes complicated by the need to connect with experts, located in different countries. Most professionals, related to the CH management, cannot access detailed data about already existing successful initiatives. The specific objective and goal of the research is the creation of an AI framework and eco-system for supporting the development and implementation of innovative business and governance models to fill up the investment gap in the adaptive re-use practices. The paper shortly describes the first steps for creating a platform designed and developed to assist and advice public entities, networked experts, private entrepreneurs and citizens in actions aiming at the valorisation of the historic and CH asset and its integration in different groups of countries to boost growth, job opportunities and social benefits, under overall sustainability constraints. The technical solutions here adopted are based on convergent methodology and networked expertise (e-expertise) technology, open data models and active knowledge extraction and processing, machine learning, collective intelligence, recommendation systems and predictive analytics, CH adaptive re-use, innovation business, and models and case-based reasoning methods. Examples of case studies giving the inception for the project components are given. © 2018 The author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the nature of data and the artificial intelligence (AI) technological trajectories, on the one hand, and on the dynamic processes triggered by demand during the evolution of an industry, on the other hand. We develop an agent-based model in which firms are data producers that compete on the markets for data and AI. The model is enriched by a public sector that fuels the purchase of data and trains the scientists that will populate firms as workforce. Through several simulation experiments, we analyze the determinants of each market structure, the corresponding relationships with innovation attainments, the pattern followed by labor and data productivity, the quality of data traded in the economy, and in which forms demand does affect innovation and the dynamics of industries. We question the established view in the literature of industrial organization according to which technological imperatives are enough to experience divergent industrial dynamics on both the markets for data and AI blueprints. Although technical change behooves if any industry pattern is to emerge, the actual unfolding is not the outcome of a specific technological trajectory, but the result of the interplay between technology-related factors and the availability of data-complementary inputs such as labor and AI capital, the market size, preferences, and public policies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>The effective and ethical use of data to inform decision-making offers
huge value to the public sector, especially when delivered by
transparent, reproducible, and robust data processing workflows. One way
that governments are unlocking this value is through making their data
publicly available, allowing more people and organisations to derive
insights. However, open data is not enough in many cases: publicly
available datasets need to be accessible in an analysis-ready form from
popular data science tools, such as R and Python, for them to realise
their full potential. This paper explores ways to maximise the impact of
open data with reference to a case study of packaging code to facilitate
reproducible analysis. We present the jtstats project, which consists of
a main Python package, and a smaller R version, for importing,
processing, and visualising large and complex datasets representing
journey times, for many transport modes and trip purposes at multiple
geographic levels, released by the UK Department for Transport (DfT).
jtstats shows how domain specific packages can enable reproducible
research within the public sector and beyond, saving duplicated effort
and reducing the risks of errors from repeated analyses. We hope that
the jtstats project inspires others, particularly those in the public
sector, to add value to their data sets by making them more accessible.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: In the context of a developing nation, children&#39;s
participation in communal life is almost non-existent. The goal of the
study is to contribute to national policies for local development that
should prioritize the safety and well-being of the most vulnerable
populations, particularly children under the age of 18. Innovating,
including children in decision-making and maintaining local services in
three pilot municipalities in order to prevent and combat all forms of
exploitation to which they are exposed. How can Youth engagement in
social and political community life be improved through better
understanding of their needs and interests, and what are the artificial
intelligence implications?
Method: The methodology was used and designed to re-validate an existing
program using pre-defined components of an agreement between the Italian
and Lebanese governments. A needs study on the socio-demographic profile
of youth and a situational analysis was conducted answering three
objectives in the program of the Child Friendly City initiative.
Results: Assuring the long-term viability and social inclusion of a
significant sociodemographic group was successfully implemented: a free
call center, software applications, a library, a digital network center,
and the involvement of children on the municipal board of directors were
established. The findings need to be adapted to various locations using
artificial intelligence (AI) solutions and strategies for social
awareness and behavior analysis.
Conclusion: The importance of this study was underscored during the
Covid-19 sanitary crisis, when some of these technologies enabled young
people in impacted areas to integrate and become aware of the pandemic&#39;s
risk. The case was based on theories such as Gender Inequalities and
Children&#39;s Inclusion, Municipal Governance &amp; Reform, Organizational
Innovation (Public Sector), and Social Inclusion, and it demonstrates
the value of innovating in the public sector and protecting vulnerable
populations through the use of AI.</abstract>

      <abstract>Now-a-days, Cybersecurity attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and presenting a growing threat to individuals, private and public sectors, especially the Denial Of Service attack (DOS) and its variant Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS). Dealing with these dangerous threats by using traditional mitigation solutions suffers from several limits and performance issues. To overcome these limitations, Machine Learning (ML) has become one of the key techniques to enrich, complement and enhance the traditional security experiences. In this context, we focus on one of the key processes that improve and optimize Machine Learning DOS-DDOS predicting models: DOS-DDOS feature selection process, particularly the wrapper process. By studying different DOS-DDOS datasets, algorithms and results of several research projects, we have reviewed and evaluated the impact on used wrapper strategies, number of DOS-DDOS features, and many commonly used metrics to evaluate DOS-DDOS prediction models based on the optimized DOS-DDOS features. In this paper, we present three important dashboards that are essential to understand the performance of three wrapper strategies commonly used in DOS-DDOS ML systems: heuristic search algorithms, meta-heuristic search and random search methods. Based on this review and evaluation study, we can observe some of wrapper strategies, algorithms, DOS-DDOS features with a relevant impact can be selected to improve the DOS-DDOS ML existing solutions. © 2021.

      <abstract>Purpose: Governments are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) algorithmic systems to increase efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery. While the diffusion of AI offers several desirable benefits, caution and attention should be posed to the accountability of AI algorithm decision-making systems in the public sector. The purpose of this paper is to establish the main challenges that an AI algorithm might bring about to public service accountability. In doing so, the paper also delineates future avenues of investigation for scholars. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: This paper builds on previous literature and anecdotal cases of AI applications in public services, drawing on streams of literature from accounting, public administration and information technology ethics. Findings: Based on previous literature, the paper highlights the accountability gaps that AI can bring about and the possible countermeasures. The introduction of AI algorithms in public services modifies the chain of responsibility. This distributed responsibility requires an accountability governance, together with technical solutions, to meet multiple accountabilities and close the accountability gaps. The paper also delineates a research agenda for accounting scholars to make accountability more “intelligent”. Originality&#x2F;value: The findings of the paper shed new light and perspective on how public service accountability in AI should be considered and addressed. The results developed in this paper will stimulate scholars to explore, also from an interdisciplinary perspective, the issues public service organizations are facing to make AI algorithms accountable. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>In the past few decades, much research has documented the importance of users as sources of innovations. Over the last 10 years, Research Policy alone has published 56 research articles investigating this phenomenon. We ask to what degree the findings of users as innovators have been absorbed by decision-makers responsible for new product development (managers) and by those who shape the contextual conditions for innovation (policy makers and public administration). A realistic perception of the sources of innovation is important as it constitutes the basis for a rational allocation of resources and thus indirectly impacts the innovation performance of companies and societies at large. In a large-scale survey of n &#x3D; 1500 decision-makers, we found support for a substantial underestimation of users as a source of innovation: While the true proportion of user innovation among the most valuable 1678 innovations in nine industries is 54.4% (as established in existing research articles), decision-makers estimate it to be 21.7%. A content analysis of transfer media (450 academic textbooks, popular innovation books, and business articles) underscores this theory-practice gap: Of 3469 text paragraphs dealing with the sources of innovation, only 2.7% mention users as innovators. We develop six propositions on the reasons for and consequences of this underestimation that may serve as a starting point for future research and practical consequences. © 2019 The Authors</abstract>

      <abstract>Application projects, may it be in healthcare and the public sector or
elsewhere, have the potential to advance foundational (&#39;&#39;genuine&#39;&#39;)
artificial intelligence (AI) research. Unfortunately, insights from
specific application projects are rarely propagated back to AI research.
This article argues for ways to facilitate such backpropagation and how
the contributions in this special issue enable exactly this
backpropagation. It also addresses the challenges that come along with
high-risk application project, which frequently occur in the area of
healthcare and the public sector due to the sensitivity of the subjects.</abstract>

      <abstract>An underlying tension exists between the fundamental elements of
accountability, government decision-making, performance management,
evidence-based policy and the measurement of results. This article
considers this through three lenses: evaluation of government policies
and programs; program structures and performance indicators; and the
challenges of big data. While use of new technologies and big data opens
up opportunities for strengthened evidence-based policy, this does not
address the tension between a disciplined results-based approach to
government decision-making and the inherently political nature of these
decisions. There remain also important challenges to the effective
development and use of big data in government.</abstract>

      <abstract>The administrative reform of the datafied public administration places
great emphasis on the classification, control, and prediction of citizen
behavior and therefore has the potential to significantly impact
citizen-state relations. There is a growing body of literature on
data-oriented activism which aims to resist and counteract existing
harmful data practices. However, little is known about the processes,
policies, and political-economic structures that make datafication
possible. There is a distinct research gap on situated and
context-specific empirical research, which critically interrogates the
premises, interests, and agendas of data-driven public administration
and how stakeholders can impact them. This paper therefore studies the
conditions of participation in public administration datafication. It
asks the overall research question of how citizens are problematized and
included in policy and practitioner discourse in the datafication of
public administration. The paper takes Norway as its case and applies
Cardullo and Kitchin&#39;s scaffold of smart citizen participation at the
system level. It makes use of a unique empirical insight into the field,
consisting of a survey, interviews, and an extensive document analysis.
Unexpectedly, we find that citizens and civil society are rarely engaged
in this administrative reform. Instead, we identify a paternalistic,
top-down, technocratic approach where the context, values, and agendas
of datafication are obscured from the citizen.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper aims to demystify the concept of data-driven public administration and lay bare the complexity involved in its implementation. It asks the overall research question of what challenges are encountered and problematised in a nascent phase of data-driven public administration implementation. The analysis is based on a multi-method research design, including a survey, follow-up interviews with practitioners and an analysis of key policy documents in the context of the Norwegian public sector. It highlights areas of both discrepancy and harmony between what has been prioritised at the policy level and the reality of implementation on the ground. In addition, unseen issues are discussed in order to broaden this perspective. Data-driven administrative reform touches upon everything from organisational culture to technical infrastructure and legal and regulatory frameworks. The complexity laid out in the analysis thus has implications for theory and practice. Nordic countries provide an interesting object of investigation, as they hold vast amounts of data and are highly digitalised, yet, in common with many other governments, they are still in a nascent phase of implementation. This paper should therefore be relevant to other jurisdictions and it provides a call to arms for civil servants and public administration scholars to engage more deeply in this phenomenon. © 2021, University of Gothenburg School of Public Administration.

      <abstract>The statue 4961&#x2F;2022 in Greek Law sets out the national framework for the regulation of emerging technologies under conditions of trustworthiness, safety and cybersecurity, consumer protection, respect for fundamental rights and the democratic rule of law. Part A’ of the Law (articles 1-27) aims to establish an adequate institutional framework for the accomodation of the potential of AI by public and private sector bodies under conditions of fairness and security, as well as to strengthen the resilience of the public administration against cyber threats. In the context of serving this purpose, Part A of the Law includes regulations for (a) the development of artificial intelligence, and (b) upgradinginformation security and data protection in the public sector. Part B of the Law (articles 28-57) aims at the exploitation by the public sector and the private market of the potential unleashed by advanced technologies and the maintenance of good practices, with the ultimate goal of consolidating the digital transformation of the country. For this purpose, Part B of the Law includes regulations regarding (i) the Internet of Things (“IoT”), (ii) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (“UAS”), (iii) distributed ledger, and (iv) 3D printing. © 2024 Antonios Broumas and Paola Charalampous.</abstract>

      <abstract>PurposeThis paper proposes adequate strategies that companies, public
administrators and organisations in the education industry can undertake
to successfully face the challenges of digital transformation in a
regional innovation system. This research considers stakeholders that
operate in the Tyrol-Veneto macroregion (the Tyrol, South Tyrol and
Veneto areas), a significant case of moderately innovative European
macroregion.Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approachThis study undertakes explorative
research based on a qualitative method. It adopts a place-based
multi-stakeholder approach to emphasise the role of three categories of
stakeholders (companies, educational system and regional governments) in
facing digital changes. More precisely, interviews with 60 stakeholders
from the Tyrol-Veneto macroregion were conducted and examined via both
text mining analysis and content analysis. First, correspondence factor
analysis was performed using IRaMuTeQ software to identify homogeneous
subsets of concepts (pillars-i.e., macroareas of strategic actions).
Second, two coding phases were implemented using NVivo software to
detect strategic fields of action and specific strategic actions
undertaken to address the challenges of digital
transformation.FindingsThe results highlight that digital transformation
is a pervasive challenge of regional innovative system that requires a
multifaceted set of strategic actions falling into three main pillars.
The first pillar, named &#x60;&#x60;culture and skills&#39;&#39;, includes three
strategic fields of action as follows: digital education, talents and
digital culture. The second pillar, named &#x60;&#x60;infrastructures and
technologies&#39;&#39;, points out the need of information, interaction and
artificial intelligence as key strategic fields of action. The third
pillar, named &#x60;&#x60;ecosystems&#39;&#39;, highlights the importance of investing
in medium- to long-term visions, partnerships and life quality. In
brief, this study shows that standalone interventions are insufficient
to tackle digital transformation from a systemic perspective. Moreover,
this study outlines the potential contribution of each category of
stakeholder to foster the digitalisation of the Tyrol-Veneto
macroregion.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the importance
of developing digital culture and skills before investing in digital
infrastructure and technology in a moderately innovative macroregion.
Companies should alter their vision before reconfiguring their business
models, invest in smart working and establish contacts with start-ups.
In addition, this study recommends that public administration should
mainly invest in digital education and partnerships, while, in terms of
education and training organisations, it suggests providing digital
skills to several cohorts of both students and workers. Policy
implications call for the creation of new occasions of cooperation among
stakeholders by fostering &#x60;&#x60;table talks&#39;&#39; as strategic and policy
actions and by making more financial resources available to encourage
the digital transformation processes.Originality&#x2F;valueThe results of
this study may be adapted to the characteristics of other regional
innovative systems and used as a reference point in terms of the
improvement of business, market and local development.</abstract>

      <abstract>In the realm of environmental governance, civil servants confront a plethora of diverse datasets, including time series, geospatial vector data, and raster data. However, unlocking the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to analyze this data poses the challenge of a widening technical proficiency gap in public administration. This paper explores the intersection of expanding environmental datasets and advanced analytics. Through a real-world project lens, our work aims to guide public administration entities, fostering seamless integration of AI-driven analytics and data-driven decision-making. We present a modular technical architecture that proposes pragmatic solutions that have the potential to empower civil servants. This approach contributes to accelerating environmental governance into an era of more informed and efficient, data-driven practices.  © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin&#x2F;Boston.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article examines the relationship between Artificial Intelligence
(AI), discretion, and bureaucratic form in public organizations. We ask:
How is the use of AI both changing and changed by the bureaucratic form
of public organizations, and what effect does this have on the use of
discretion? The diffusion of information and communication technologies
(ICTs) has changed administrative behavior in public organizations.
Recent advances in AI have led to its increasing use, but too little is
known about the relationship between this distinct form of ICT and to
both the exercise of discretion and bureaucratic form along the
continuum from street- to system-levels. We articulate a theoretical
framework that integrates work on the unique effects of AI on discretion
and its relationship to task and organizational context with the theory
of system-level bureaucracy. We use this framework to examine two
strongly differing cases of public sector AI use: health insurance
auditing, and policing. We find AI&#39;s effect on discretion is nonlinear
and nonmonotonic as a function of bureaucratic form. At the same time,
the use of AI may act as an accelerant in transitioning organizations
from street- and screen-level to system-level bureaucracies, even if
these organizations previously resisted such changes.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article examines the implicit space grammar of the cultural vibrancy of the region of Halland in Southwest Sweden. By using a new computational approach, we implement for the first time a methodology that allows us, on the one side, to extrapolate the complex dynamic evolution of the region’s cultural geography and, on the other side, to diagnose the structural causes of its eventual decay. The results provide a basis for a more systematic approach to evidence-based policy design at the regional scale, and for a more participatory, bottom-up public decision-making in the cultural and other policy spheres. © The Author(s) 2019.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms govern in subtle yet fundamental
ways the way we live and are transforming our societies. The promise of
efficient, low-cost, or &#x60;&#x60;neutral&#39;&#39; solutions harnessing the potential
of big data has led public bodies to adopt algorithmic systems in the
provision of public services. As AI algorithms have permeated
high-stakes aspects of our public existence-from hiring and education
decisions to the governmental use of enforcement powers (policing) or
liberty-restricting decisions (bail and sentencing)-this necessarily
raises important accountability questions: What accountability
challenges do AI algorithmic systems bring with them, and how can we
safeguard accountability in algorithmic decision-making? Drawing on a
decidedly public administration perspective, and given the current
challenges that have thus far become manifest in the field, we
critically reflect on and map out in a conceptually guided manner the
implications of these systems, and the limitations they pose, for public
accountability.</abstract>

      <abstract>Transparency is widely acknowledged as a core value in the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, scholarship on AI technologies and their regulation often casts this need for transparency in terms of requirements for the explanation of algorithmic outputs and&#x2F;or decisions produced with the involvement of opaque black-box AI systems. Our article argues that this discourse has re-interpreted and reshaped transparency in fundamental ways away from its original meaning. The target of transparency - in most cases, the provider of AI software - determines and shapes what is made visible to the outside world, and there is no external check on the validity and accuracy of such mediated accounts and explanations, opening transparency up for manipulation. Through a theoretically informed and critical analysis of the transparency provisions in the European Union&#39;s AI Act proposal, the article shows that the substitution of transparency with mediated explanations faces important technical constraints, creates opportunities and incentives for both providers and public-sector users of AI systems to adopt opaque practices, and reinforces secrecy requirements that gag accountability in practice. An approach to transparency as disclosure thus becomes necessary, even if not sufficient in and of itself, to ensure the accountable development and use of AI technologies in the European Union. Transparency needs to be reclaimed as a core concept, accountability tailored and reinforced and the necessity for secrecy re-examined and cordoned off.  © The Author(s), 2022.

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that offers
both great benefits and poses a number of challenges. Effective
governance is important to ensure that the ethical concerns are met.
James Butcher and Irakli Beridze provide an overview of current AI
governance activities, covering notable examples across the private
sector, public sector, research and multi-stakeholder organisations, and
the UN. They take a deeper look at regulation, then reflect on the
future of AI governance, touching on some frameworks that may offer
guidance for the beneficial development of AI technologies while
mitigating the risks.</abstract>

      <abstract>With the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a severe negative
impact on all aspects of life, whether it be a job, business, health,
education, etc. As a result, institutions, schools, colleges and
universities are being shut down globally to control the spread of
Covid-19. Due to this reason, the mode of education has a dramatic shift
from on-campus to online learning with virtual teaching using digital
technologies. This sudden shift has elevated the stress level among the
students because they were not mentally prepared for it, and hence their
academic performance has been adversely affected. So, there needs to
figure out the underlying process to make online learning more
productive. Thus, to obtain this objective, the present study has
integrated the modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Task
Technology Fit Model (TTF), DeLone and McLean Model of Information
Systems Success (DMISM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
Technology (UTAUT) model. A sample of 404 students was obtained, where
202 students were from the top ten public sector universities, and 202
were from the top ten private sector universities of Punjab. Structural
Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to analyze the hypothesized framework
using AMOS. The results reveal that institutional factors positively
impact students&#39; performance mediated by user satisfaction and task
technology fit. Similarly, institutional factors affect performance
through mediation by user satisfaction and actual usage in sequence.
Cognitive absorption was used as a moderator between institutional
factors and user satisfaction. In the end, theoretical and practical
inferences have also been discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Algorithmic technologies and artificial intelligence are centred on data
and generate new business models, known as the data-driven economy. In
the European Union context, the development of such new business is
accompanied by a regulatory and political framework. An important aspect
of this regulatory framework regards the legal conditions that enable
the data collection, availability, sharing, use and reuse. Within the
larger context, this article analyses the development of the European
Union regulatory framework governing the availability, sharing and reuse
of public sector data, also referred to as Public Sector Information
policy. Anchored in the analytical tools provided by Discursive
Institutionalism and Critical Data Studies and after studying the
evolution of this policy over 25 years, this article argues that
economic considerations have been overwhelmingly decisive in the
European Union Public Sector Information policy and much less attention
has been paid to fundamental rights and democracy issues. It also shows
how European Union Public Sector Information policy contributes to the
data infrastructure, enabling a thriving data-driven economy. In doing
so, this article argues that the possible problematic effects of this
new data-driven economy are not only affordances of the technology
itself but are also the result of political and regulatory choices. More
globally, the article stresses the need for policymakers to inscribe
each of the policies and regulations affecting the digital
transformation in the framework of fundamental rights and democracy.</abstract>

      <abstract>Students&#39; feelings of relatedness (i.e., feeling connected to others) are crucial for success in any learning environment; however, online courses often limit relatedness development, either by removing spontaneous interaction (e.g., asynchronous delivery) or by introducing seemingly incompatible online and on-campus factions (e.g., synchronous hybrid delivery). It was hypothesized that the strengths of one delivery mode could offset the weaknesses of the other. The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate an online discussion board intervention designed to scaffold relatedness development. Deci and Ryan&#39;s (1985) self-determination theory was adopted as the theoretical framework. Participants were 83 graduate students enrolled in synchronous hybrid Masters of Business Administration (MBA), Masters of Public Administration (MPA), and Masters of Aviation (MS-Avit) programs offered at a large midwestern research university. This study used a convergent parallel mixed methods approach (QUAN + qual &#x3D; triangulation). The methods involved a pretest-posttest experimental design in which students were randomly assigned to either the experimental group, wherein they participated in the intervention, or the control group, wherein they attended classes without any auxiliary interactions. The results indicated that students who participated in the intervention improved their self-efficacy for developing relatedness with individuals who attended online. The qualitative analysis generated three key themes: relatedness beliefs, program delivery, and student-interface interaction. This study holds practical implications for online learning in that it explicated how a threaded discussion can be used to scaffold relatedness development. The theoretical implications of this study involved the substantiation of three key elements of SDT: the basic needs, the types of motivation, and the importance of contextual support. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

Educators, mental health professionals, juvenile justice officers, and child welfare caseworkers often have first-hand knowledge of the trials uniquely faced by these vulnerable youth and are charged with mitigating harmful risks, such as mental health challenges, child abuse, drug use, and sex trafficking. Yet, less is known about whether or how social service providers assess and mitigate theonline risk experiences of youth under their care. Therefore, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program, we conducted interviews with 37 social service providers (SSPs) who work with underprivileged youth to determine what (if any) online risks are most concerning to them given their role in youth protection, how they assess or become aware of these online risk experiences, and whether they see value in the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution for online risk detection. Overall, online sexual risks (e.g., sexual grooming and abuse) and cyberbullying were the most salient concern across all social service domains, especially when these experiences crossed the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds. Yet, SSPs had to rely heavily on youth self-reports to know whether and when online risks occurred, which required building a trusting relationship with youth; otherwise, SSPs became aware only after a formal investigation had been launched. Therefore, most SSPs found value in the potential for using AI as an early detection system and to monitor youth, but they were concerned that such a solution would not be feasible due to a lack of resources to adequately respond to online incidences, access to the necessary digital trace data (e.g., social media), context, and concerns about violating the trust relationships they built with youth. Thus, such automated risk detection systems should be designed and deployed with caution, as their implementation could cause youth to mistrust adults, thereby limiting the receipt of necessary guidance and support. We add to the bodies of research on adolescent online safety and the benefits and challenges of leveraging algorithmic systems in the public sector. © 2023 ACM.</abstract>

      <abstract>A new model for the control of financial processes based on metric graphs is presented. Our motivation has its roots in the current interest in finding effective algorithms to detect and classify relations among elements of a social network. For example, the analysis of a set of companies working for a given public administration or other figures in which automatic fraud detection systems are needed. Given a set ω and a proximity function φ:ω×ω→ℝ+, we define a new metric for ω by considering a path distance in ω that is considered as a graph. We analyze the properties of such a distance, and several procedures for defining the initial proximity matrix (φ(a,b))(a,b) ω×ω. Using this formalism, we state our main idea regarding fraud detection: financial fraud can be detected because it produces a meaningful local change of density in the metric space defined in this way.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.</abstract>

      <abstract>Future scenarios foresee a city as a fragmented and uneven system in relation to rapidly evolving environmental, economic and social phenomena. The traditional urban planning tools, based on a theoretical-predictive approach, adapt poorly. We need to rethink how to govern the transformations of a city, which can be described by models of urban metabolism. City Sensing has changed the way a city is explored and used. With the transition from digitisation to datafication, through a computational approach, one can process georeferenced datasets within algorithms in order to achieve a higher quality of the project. This process exploits data provided by public administrations, companies and citizens taking part in inclusive and adaptive urban planning. © 2021 Firenze University Press.</abstract>

      <abstract>Cyberattacks are a growing concern for companies and public administrations. The literature shows that analyzing network-layer traffic can detect intrusion attempts. However, such detection usually implies studying every datagram in a computer network. Therefore, routers routing a significant volume of network traffic do not perform an in-depth analysis of every packet. Instead, they analyze traffic patterns based on network flows. However, even gathering and analyzing flow data has a high-computational cost, and therefore routers usually apply a sampling rate to generate flow data. Adjusting the sampling rate is a tricky problem. If the sampling rate is low, much information is lost and some cyberattacks may be neglected, but if the sampling rate is high, routers cannot deal with it. This paper tries to characterize the influence of this parameter in different detection methods based on machine learning. To do so, we trained and tested malicious-traffic detection models using synthetic flow data gathered with several sampling rates. Then, we double-check the above models with flow data from the public BoT-IoT dataset and with actual flow data collected on RedCAYLE, the Castilla y León regional academic network. © 2023 The Author(s)</abstract>

      <abstract>Despite the current popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) and a
steady increase in publications over time, few studies have investigated
AI in public contexts. As a result, assumptions about the drivers,
challenges, and impacts of AI in government are far from conclusive. By
using a case study that involves a large research university in England
and two different county councils in a multiyear collaborative project
around AI, we study the challenges that interorganizational
collaborations face in adopting AI tools and implementing organizational
routines to address them. Our findings reveal the most important
challenges facing such collaborations: a resistance to sharing data due
to privacy and security concerns, insufficient understanding of the
required and available data, a lack of alignment between project
interests and expectations around data sharing, and a lack of engagement
across organizational hierarchy. Organizational routines capable of
overcoming such challenges include working on-site, presenting the
benefits of data sharing, reframing problems, designating joint
appointments and boundary spanners, and connecting participants in the
collaboration at all levels around project design and purpose.</abstract>

      <abstract>A jurisprudence search system is a solution that makes available to its users a set of decisions made by public bodies on the recurring understanding as a way of understanding the law. In the similarity of legal decisions, jurisprudence seeks subsidies that provide stability, uniformity, and some predictability in the analysis of a case decided. This paper presents a proposed solution architecture for the jurisprudence search system of the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), with a view to building and expanding the knowledge generated regarding the economic defense of competition to support the agency’s final procedural business activities. We conducted a literature review and a survey to investigate the characteristics and functionalities of the jurisprudence search systems used by Brazilian public administration agencies. Our findings revealed that the prevailing technologies of Brazilian agencies in developing jurisdictional search systems are Java programming language and Apache Solr as the main indexing engine. Around 87% of the jurisprudence search systems use machine learning classification. On the other hand, the systems do not use too many artificial intelligence and morphological construction techniques. No agency participating in the survey claimed to use ontology to treat structured and unstructured data from different sources and formats. © 2021 by the authors.

      <abstract>Social distancing and temperature screening have been widely employed to counteract the COVID-19 pandemic, sparking great interest from academia, industry and public administrations worldwide. While most solutions have dealt with these aspects separately, their combination would greatly benefit the continuous monitoring of public spaces and help trigger effective countermeasures. This work presents milliTRACE-IR, a joint mmWave radar and infrared imaging sensing system performing unobtrusive and privacy preserving human body temperature screening and contact tracing in indoor spaces. milliTRACE-IR combines, via a robust sensor fusion approach, mmWave radars and infrared thermal cameras. It achieves fully automated measurement of distancing and body temperature, by jointly tracking the subjects&#39;s faces in the thermal camera image plane and the human motion in the radar reference system. Moreover, milliTRACE-IR performs contact tracing: a person with high body temperature is reliably detected by the thermal camera sensor and subsequently traced across a large indoor area in a non-invasive way by the radars. When entering a new room, a subject is re-identified among several other individuals by computing gait-related features from the radar reflections through a deep neural network and using a weighted extreme learning machine as the final re-identification tool. Experimental results, obtained from a real implementation of milliTRACE-IR, demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in distance&#x2F;trajectory estimation, inter-personal distance estimation (effective for subjects getting as close as 0.2 m), and accurate temperature monitoring (max. errors of 0.5 °C). Furthermore, milliTRACE-IR provides contact tracing through highly accurate (95%) person re-identification, in less than 20 seconds.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article explores the challenges surrounding generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) in public administrations and its impact on
human-machine interactions within the public sector. First, it aims to
deconstruct the reasons for distrust in GenAI in public administrations.
The risks currently linked to GenAI in the public sector are often
similar to those of conventional AI. However, while some risks remain
pertinent, others are less so because GenAI has limited explainability,
which, in return, limits its uses in public administrations.
Confidentiality, marking of GenAI outputs and errors are specific
matters for which responses should be technical as well as cultural, as
they are pushing the boundaries of our instrumental conceptions of
machines. Second, this article proposes some paradigm shifts in the
perspective of using GenAI in public administrations due to the radical
change caused by its language-based nature. GenAI represents a profound
break from the &#x60;&#x60;numerical&#39;&#39; nature of AI systems implemented in
public administrations to date. The transformative impact of GenAI on
the intellectual production of the state raises fears of the
replacement, or rather enslavement, of civil servants to machines. The
article argues for the development of critical thinking as a specific
skill for civil servants who have become highly specialized and will
have to think with a machine that is eclectic by nature. It anticipates
a transformation in the political nature of public administrations,
which should lead to more considerations for the strategic stake related
to training corpus and for our conceptualization of the neutrality of
AI.</abstract>

      <abstract>Both public administrations and private owners of large building stocks need to work out plans for the management of their property, while having to deal with yearly budget limitations. Particularly for the former, this is a rather critical challenge, since public administrations are given the responsibility of sticking to very strict budget distributions over the years. As a consequence, when planning the actions to be taken on their building stocks in order to comply with their current use and the legislation in-force, they need to classify refurbishment priorities. The aim of this paper is to develop a first tool based on Bayesian Networks that offers an effective decision support service for owners even in case some information is incomplete. This tool can be used to evaluate the compliance of existing buildings with the latest standards. The decision support platform proposed includes a multi-criteria evaluation approach combining several performance indicators, each of which related to a specific regulatory area. This tool can be applied to existing buildings, where the building with the lowest score shows the highest priority of intervention. Also, the platform performs an assessment of expected costs for required refurbishment or renovation actions. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerated vaccine development to prevent the spread of the virus and control the disease. Given the sustained high infectivity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, there is an ongoing interest in developing COVID-19 serology tests to monitor population-level immunity. To address this critical need, we designed a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) using five structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, detecting IgG and IgM antibodies to monitor changes in COVID-19 immunity levels. Our platform not only tracked longitudinal immunity levels but also categorized COVID-19 immunity into three groups: protected, unprotected, and infected, based on the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies. We operated two xVFAs in parallel to detect IgG and IgM antibodies using a total of 40 μL of human serum sample in &lt;20 min per test. After the assay images of the paper-based sensor panel were captured using a mobile phone-based custom-designed optical reader and then processed by a neural network-based serodiagnostic algorithm. The serodiagnostic algorithm was trained with 120 measurements&#x2F;tests and 30 serum samples from 7 randomly selected individuals and was blindly tested with 31 serum samples from 8 different individuals, collected before vaccination as well as after vaccination or infection, achieving an accuracy of 89.5%. The competitive performance of the xVFA, along with its portability, cost-effectiveness, and rapid operation, makes it a promising computational point-of-care (POC) serology test for monitoring COVID-19 immunity, aiding in timely decisions on the administration of booster vaccines and general public health policies to protect vulnerable populations. © 2024 The Authors.

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalisation have become an integral part of public governance. While digital technology is expected to enhance neutrality and accuracy in decision-making, it raises concerns about the status of public values and democratic principles. Guided by the theoretical concepts of input, throughput and output democracy, this article analyses how democratic principles have been interpreted and defended in EU policy formulations relating to digital technology over the last decade. The emergence of AI policy has changed the conditions for democratic input and throughput legitimacy, which is an expression of a shift in power and influence between public and private sectors. Democratic input values in AI production are promoted by ethical guidelines directed towards the industry, while democratic throughput, e.g., accountability and transparency, receive less attention in EU AI policy. This indicates future political implications for the ability of citizens to influence technological change and pass judgement on accountable actors. © 2022 The Authors</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence in public administration is both inevitable and
potentially quite beneficial. Its assistive form offers access,
efficiency and convenience; while the gains potentially are even larger
in its augmentive &#x60;machine learning&#39; form. Offsetting risks include
disadvantaging technology poor clients, and poor design which fails
adequately to reflect social welfare principles or provide adequate
accountability and redress for errors; a risk heightened for machine
learning. This paper reviews some of the different forms and settings
for AI in social security and argues that the Australian experience to
date has been very mixed due to poor or rushed AI designs, poor
understanding of client characteristics, and inadequate understanding of
dynamics within contracted-out government services settings.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper reviews illustrative aspects of the introduction of artificial intelligence into Australian social security&#39;s (Centrelink) original decision making and merits review. The review highlights the complexity and nuanced character of evaluating greater reliance on artifical intellignce over human decision-making systems. It argues that technological change is inevitable, and is not necessarily either an unadulterated boon or bane, but calls for careful planning and a comparative assessment of the benefits and limitations of artificial intelligence versus human systems. In social security, it is concluded that particular attention should be given to avoiding discrimination against citizens who are technology poor or otherwise vulnerable. © 2019 Australian Social Policy Association</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies are rapidly maturing and proliferating through all public and private sectors. The potential for these technologies to do good and to help us in our everyday lives is immense. But there is a risk that unless managed and controlled AI can also cause us harm. Questions about regulation, what form it takes and who is responsible for governance are only just beginning to be answered. In May 2019, 42 countries came together to support a global governance framework for AI. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles on Artificial Intelligence (OECD (2019) OECD principles on AI. Available at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;going-digital&#x2F;ai&#x2F;principles&#x2F; (accessed 2 March 2020)) saw like-minded democracies of the world commit to common AI values of trust and respect. In Europe, the European Commission’s (EC) new president, Ursula von der Leyen has made calls for a General Data Protection Regulation style. As a first step the EC has published a white paper: ‘On Artificial Intelligence – A European Approach to Excellence and Trust’ (European Commission (2020) Report, Europa, February). In February 2020, the UK government has published a report on ‘Artificial Intelligence in the Public Sector’ (The Committee on Standards in Public Life (2020) Artificial intelligence and public standards. Report, UK Government, February). This article discusses some of the potential threats AI may hold if left unregulated. It provides a brief overview of the regulatory activities for AI worldwide, and in more detail the current UK AI regulatory landscape. Finally, the article looks at the role that the information professional might play in AI and ML. © The Author(s) 2020.</abstract>

      <abstract>EmpoderaData - from the Spanish word empoderar &#39;to empower&#39; - is a partnership research project between the University of Manchester (UK), Fundação Getulio Vargas (Brazil), Universidad del Rosario (Colombia) and Data-Pop Alliance (US and France). The project builds upon a successful data-driven, research-led paid internship programme in the UK (Q-Step) which enables undergraduate social science students to practise data skills through immersion in the workplace. Two-hundred and fifty students have benefited from the Q-Step programme in six years, many graduating into analytical careers in civic society and industry. EmpoderaData aims to build on this experiential learning initiative by developing a data fellowship programme in order to foster and develop data literacy skills in Latin America, led by the need to address society&#39;s most pressing issues and using the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). EmpoderaData Phase 1 explored whether the internship model would have relevance and usefulness within the context of three Latin American case study countries (Brazil, Colombia and Mexico). The team set out to establish a baseline of the state of data literacy and existing training programs in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. As part of a &#39;Big Data for the Common Good&#39; event, a workshop was held in São Paulo with thirty participants representing data literacy advocacy or policy formation and drawn from civil society, academia, the private and public sector. The main conclusions from this first phase are: (1) the most requested data literacy training need is for basic skills, including introductory statistics, foundation data analysis and methodological skills; (2) paid data fellowship models are acknowledged as a useful intervention; and (3) the notion of a &#39;hybrid&#39; professional to build data literacy capacities for &#39;social science&#39; purposes provides a practical way forward. In the EmpoderaData Phase 2 project our focus was on Colombia to explore the challenges and opportunities of developing a pilot data fellowship model there. Engaging with national, regional and international capacity development efforts, this highlighted a demand for partnerships between universities and organisations working on the social challenges represented by the SDGs. Partnerships ensure that the in-country data literacy pipeline is strengthened in a home-grown, self-sustaining way, producing a steady flow of data literate graduates into the institutions and sectors where critical data skills are most needed. We report on how the EmpoderaData project is exploring working with students studying Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees at the Universidad del Rosario, to improve the application of statistical methods to the social sciences. The aim is to strengthen STEM skills and develop youth empowerment across Colombia, urban and rural areas, to improve the quality of statistical education at the national level, and support the skills needed to deliver the SDGs. In parallel, the Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) Business School in São Paulo agreed to trial the work-placement programme in their undergraduate business and public policy degrees through a programme entitled &#39;The FGV Q-Step Center to improve quantitative skills in undergraduate business students&#39;. This two-year-long funded study will enable us to explore the transferability of the internship model from the UK to Brazil. The paper will discuss how the programme was established (following the lessons learned from EmpoderaData), explain how this model will be implemented in FGV, especially paying attention to how the curriculum will develop to support it, and how the impact of the programme will be monitored. The knowledge exchange generated from this study will complement the research conducted through the EmpoderaData project. The paper will cover the progress of the EmpoderaData project and FGV-Q-Step Center to date and explore how we are developing these initiatives, the challenges we have faced, and how through partnership working we are developing capacity building in statistical and data skills training. © 2021 - The authors.

      <abstract>This paper examines the implementation of artificial intelligence in decision-making processes within public administration, with a focus on addressing the challenges of transparency, accountability, and the intelligibility of AI-generated decisions. The paper discusses the importance of imputability in decisions made with deep learning algorithms. It emphasises that by granting public administrations full control over the training dataset, source code, and knowledge base, the imputability of the decision can be ensured. This control enables administrations to validate the relevancy and accuracy of the algorithm&#39;s training data, address potential biases, and comply with legal and ethical requirements. The paper then proposes the use of Large Language Models (LLM) as a solution to enhance the transparency and motivation behind AI-assisted decisions. It highlights that LLMs can generate articulate and comprehensible textual outputs that closely resemble human-generated decisions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the decision-making process. Furthermore, the paper emphasises the significance of providing access to the training dataset, source code, and individual administrative precedents to enhance transparency and accountability. It argues that by offering these components, stakeholders can evaluate the validity and reliability of AI-assisted decisions, fostering trust in the decision-making process. © 2023, Universita degli Studi di Milano.

      <abstract>Legacy software poses a critical challenge for organizations due to the costs of maintaining and modernizing outdated systems, as well as the scarcity of experts in aging programming languages. The issue extends beyond commercial applications, affecting public administration, as exemplified by the urgent need for COBOL programmers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, this work introduces a modernization approach based on dynamic language product lines, a subset of dynamic software product lines. This approach leverages open language implementations and dynamically generated micro-languages for the incremental migration of legacy systems to modern technologies. The language can be reconfigured at runtime to adapt to the execution of either legacy or modern code, and to generate a compatibility layer between the data types handled by the two languages. Through this process, the costs of modernizing legacy systems can be spread across several iterations, as developers can replace legacy code incrementally, with legacy and modern code coexisting until a complete refactoring is possible. By moving the overhead of making legacy and modern features work together in a hybrid system from the system implementation to the language implementation, the quality of the system itself does not degrade due to the introduction of glue code. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we present a case study on a COBOL system migration to Java. Using the Neverlang language workbench to create modular and reconfigurable language implementations, both the COBOL interpreter and the application evolve to spread the development effort across several iterations. Through this study, this work presents a viable solution for organizations dealing with the complexity of modernizing legacy software to contemporary technologies. The contributions of this work are (i) a language-oriented, incremental refactoring process for legacy systems, (ii) a concrete application of open language implementations, and (iii) a general template for the implementation of interoperability between languages in hybrid systems. © 2024 The Author(s)</abstract>

      <abstract>Public transparency is becoming increasingly complex due to the volume
of data generated by government, the plurality of uses given to public
data, their dispersal over different organizations, bodies and units and
the diversity of mechanisms through which they are channelled. All this
requires government agencies not only to improve data management but
also to adopt procedures and structures that facilitate decision-making
regarding data&#39;s use and quality. In this context, this study defines
data governance as the set of principles, values and standards that
guide interaction in decision-making among stakeholders who create,
manage and use data. This study uses the analysis of three data
governance cases to identify the defining characteristics of data
governance (data governance&#39;s design, the institutional position on data
governance in the organizational structure, the stakeholders involved in
data governance, the interaction channels provided and the functions
attributed to them). Based on these elements, three models of data
governance promoted by government agencies are observed. In the light of
the data governance models analysed, the final reflection identifies how
data governance can contribute to improve public transparency.</abstract>

      <abstract>Effective programming of research and development (R&amp;D) support, adjusted to the actual potential of beneficiaries, requires the use of modern analytical tools. An efficient R&amp;D support system requires up-to-date data on technological trends, ongoing (and planning) research, market needs and developing innovation. The most popular programming methods were based on the analysis of data with a 4 to 5-year time delay until recently. Having described the method of refining information from unstructured data, we explore how to make it possible not only to solve the issue of up-to-date data but to identify of the latest trends in R&amp;D activities. The analytical tools we describe were already fully functional in 2018 and are constantly being improved. The article presents the potential of one tool that can be applied in public support institutions. Methods of identifying and diagnosing technology trends are presented within the case study of the electric car technology trend. The presented case study shows the effectiveness of the method we developed for identifying and diagnosing areas requiring support from public funds. Public institutions, including public institutions supporting R&amp;D and innovation processes, can apply tools that allow an increase in the quality of public support programmes offered, but also beneficial for the quality of strategic resources management within the institution itself. The comparison of the predictions made by the described tools with the classifications made by experts, the former are more accurate and precise. Moreover, the results of the analyses performed by the presented model are not influenced by distorting factors—fads, trends, political pressures, or processes with an unidentified, non-substantive background. It should be emphasized that the accuracy of the whole model is 0.84. The described tools and methods are already directly applicable in many areas related to the support of R&amp;D activity worldwide. The article presents a solution that effectively enables the management of more precise programmes supporting innovative activities used for the first time in Poland. It is also one of the first uses of these methods by public administration in the world. Our approach not only strengthens improved adjustment of the support offered for R&amp;D activity, but also makes it possible to apply and improve management methods in public institutions. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>This exploratory research used Google to collect atypical data concerning Korea and Japan’s nation branding and used these to provide a structural description of the international perspectives of the countries’ cultures. Japan differs from Korea by focusing on developing various media, content, and geographical factors through fostering and supporting private-run local brands; also, variations relating to history, strategy, and system have resulted in different online nation-branding practices between the two countries. This study proposes several methods of enhancing nation branding and suggests further analysis of both private and public sector discussions, traditional and up-to-date channels, and various media content. © 2017 Heewon Cha, Yunna Rhee and Chung Joo Chung © 2017 Heewon Cha, Yunna Rhee and Chung Joo Chung.</abstract>

      <abstract>Cost overruns (COs) in public sector social housing programs (PSSHPs) will continue unabated without immediate intervention to resolve the ad hoc amalgamation of root cause ontologies. This study applied a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) multicriteria decision support model to evaluate and prioritize the overall cost overrun risk in PSSHPs. In a Caribbean Small Island Developing State (SIDS) context, a questionnaire survey measuring 41 perceived critical risk factors (CRFs) was used to derive the risk impact and normalized impact values from 150 professional participants. Twenty-two normalized CRFs and four principal risk groups&#39; (PRGs) membership functions were determined using fuzzy synthetic knowledge-based inference procedures. Politically linked contractors and intentionally inferior building contracts caused most PSSHP cost overruns. The FSE risk model reveals that political PRG is the major root cause of COs, followed by socioeconomic, technical, and psychological PRGs. The study found that the overall risk level (ORL) of PSSHPs is high, meaning that government investment in public housing is a high-risk endeavor and ill-informed choices could lead to &quot;wicked&quot;social problems. Defuzzifying cost risks provided deeper insights into the nature and scope of the risk and related management implications that lead to unsustainable decision-making practices and provide opportunities for adequate control strategies to maintain economic viability. This research evidenced the fusion of different CO ontologies and raises awareness of the hidden political risk factors that should be prioritized to achieve sustainable PSSHP decision-making practices. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether the amount of local governments’ debt can be predicted by the level of political competition. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: The study uses the artificial neural network (ANN) to test whether ANN can “learn” from the observed data and make reliable out-of-sample predictions of the target variable value (i.e. a local government’s debt level) for given values of the predictor variables. An ANN is a non-parametric prediction tool, that is, not susceptible to the common limitations of regression-based parametric forecasting models, e.g. multi-collinearity and latent non-linear relations. Findings: The study finds that “political competition” is a useful predictor of a local government’s debt level. Moreover, a positive relationship between political competition and debt level is indicated, i.e. increases in political competition typically leads to increases in a local government’s level of debt. Originality&#x2F;value: The study contributes to public sector reporting literature by investigating whether public debt levels can be predicted on the basis of political competition while discounting factors such as “political ideology” and “fragmentation”. The findings of the study are consistent with the expectations posited by public choice theory and have implications for public sector auditing, policy and reporting standards, particularly in terms of minimising potential political opportunism. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this contemporary era, where a large part of the world population is deluged by extensive use of the internet and social media, terrorists have found it a potential opportunity to execute their vicious plans. They have got a befitting medium to reach out to their targets to spread propaganda, disseminate training content, operate virtually, and further their goals. To restrain such activities, information over the internet in context of terrorism needs to be analyzed to channel it to appropriate measures in combating terrorism. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) accounts for a felicitous solution to this problem, which is an emerging discipline of leveraging publicly accessible sources of information over the internet by effectively utilizing it to extract intelligence. The process of OSINT extraction is broadly observed to be in three phases (i) Data Acquisition, (ii) Data Enrichment, and (iii) Knowledge Inference. In the context of terrorism, researchers have given noticeable contributions in compliance with these three phases. However, a comprehensive review that delineates these research contributions into an integrated workflow of intelligence extraction has not been found. The paper presents the most current review in OSINT, reflecting how the various state-of-the-art tools and techniques can be applied in extracting terrorism-related textual information from publicly accessible sources. Various data mining and text analysis-based techniques, that is, natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning have been reviewed to extract and evaluate textual data. Additionally, towards the end of the paper, we discuss challenges and gaps observed in different phases of OSINT extraction.

      <abstract>Although the use of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in public
organizations has increased in recent years, three crucial gaps remain
unresolved. First, little empirical evidence has been produced to
examine the deployment of chatbots in government contexts. Second,
existing research does not distinguish clearly between the drivers of
adoption and the determinants of success and, therefore, between the
stages of adoption and implementation. Third, most current research does
not use a multidimensional perspective to understand the adoption and
implementation of AI in government organizations. Our study addresses
these gaps by exploring the following question: what determinants
facilitate or impede the adoption and implementation of chatbots in the
public sector? We answer this question by analyzing 22 state agencies
across the U.S.A. that use chatbots. Our analysis identifies ease of use
and relative advantage of chatbots, leadership and innovative culture,
external shock, and individual past experiences as the main drivers of
the decisions to adopt chatbots. Further, it shows that different types
of determinants (such as knowledge-base creation and maintenance,
technology skills and system crashes, human and financial resources,
cross-agency interaction and communication, confidentiality and safety
rules and regulations, and citizens&#39; expectations, and the COVID-19
crisis) impact differently the adoption and implementation processes
and, therefore, determine the success of chatbots in a different manner.
Future research could focus on the interaction among different types of
determinants for both adoption and implementation, as well as on the
role of specific stakeholders, such as IT vendors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in the public sector
worldwide has increased in recent years. Despite its increasing use,
public administration research in this area faces some limitations.
First, much of the current research is theoretical and normative,
lacking substantial empirical data to assess the results of chatbots.
Second, the specific effects of chatbots on government organization
operations and their interactions with the public are not well
understood. The purpose of this empirical study is to explore how
chatbots influence government operations and their relationship with
citizens. We conducted in-depth interviews with officials and employees
from twenty-two state agencies in the United States. Leveraging insights
from public sector innovation and digital transformation literature, our
study reveals various process- and product-related outputs and outcomes
within organizations and in government-citizen interactions stemming
from chatbot use.</abstract>

      <abstract>In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI)
technology has become increasingly common in the public sector. Users
have been switching their experiences in handling businesses from
interactions with human staff to those with robots. Prior studies have
focused on investigating the key factors that influence users&#39; adoption
of public service robots; however, only a few have considered users&#39;
switching behaviors from traditional human services to robotic ones.
This study employs a push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework derived from the
human migration field to understand the factors that affect users&#39;
switching intentions in the context of public service robot
applications. The research model was tested with 419 valid responses
among users who had experienced both human services and public service
robots in Chinese government service halls. The structural equation
modeling (SEM) method was applied to quantitatively analyze the data.
This study sheds new light on the key determinants of users&#39; switching
intentions toward public service robots from the perspectives of push,
pull, and mooring effects. The results can help practitioners and
managers understand users&#39; intentions for such switches and make
scientific decisions to encourage citizens&#39; positive responses to
service robots.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public sectors are utilizing AI-based self-service technology (SST) at an accelerating rate, given its potential for improving work efficiency and user experience, reducing service costs, and relieving human workloads. However, there is a limited understanding of the factors influencing citizens&#39; user experience when services supported by AI-based SST are provided. Thus, with insights from the Consumer Value Theory, this paper aims to explore the factors that are important to AI-based SST user experience and the conditional role of trust in government. The on-site survey of 379 citizens in a public service center in China indicates that user experience positively relates to personalization and aesthetics and negatively associates with perceived time spent on the AI-based self-service machines. In addition, the results suggest that citizens with more trust in government are more likely to have a pleasant experience coming from AI-based SST&#39;s personalization and aesthetics. Public managers should ensure that the AI-based SST is aesthetically appealing and should be able to personalize the delivery of the right contents to the right person at the right time. Furthermore, they should always prioritize cultivating more trust from citizens to achieve a more positive user experience. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: The use of digital health technologies was an integral part to China&#39;s early response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Existing literatures have analyzed and discussed implemented digital health innovations from the perspective of technologies, whereas how policy mechanisms contributed to the formulation of the digital health landscape for COVID-19 was overlooked. This study aimed to examine the contexts and key mechanisms in China&#39;s rapid mobilization of digital health interventions in response to COVID-19, and to document and share lessons learned. Methods: Policy documents were identified and retrieved from government portals and recognized media outlets. Data on digital health interventions were collected through three consecutive surveys administered between 23 January 2020 and 31 March 2020 by China Academy of Information and Communication Technology (CAICT) affiliated to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Participants were member companies of the Internet Health alliance established by MIIT and the National Health Commission (NHC) in June 2016. Self-report digital interventions focusing on social and economic recovery were excluded. Two hundred and sixty-six unique digital health interventions meeting our criteria were extracted from 175 narratives on digital health interventions submitted by 116 participating companies. Thematic analysis was conducted to describe the scope and priority of policies advocating for the use of digital health technologies and the implementation pattern of digital health interventions. Data limitations precluded an evaluation of the impact of digital health interventions over a longer time frame. Results: Between January and March 2020, national policy directives promoting the use of digital technologies for the containment of COVID-19 collectively advocated for use cases in emergency planning and preparedness, public health response, and clinical services. Interventions to strengthen clinical services were mentioned more than the other two themes (n &#x3D; 15, 62.5% (15&#x2F;24)). Using digital technologies for public health response was mentioned much less than clinical services (n &#x3D; 5, 20.8% (5&#x2F;24)). Emergency planning and preparedness was least mentioned (n &#x3D; 4, 16.7% (4&#x2F;24)). Interventions in support of clinical services disproportionately favored healthcare facilities in less resource-constraint settings. Digital health interventions shared the same pattern of distribution. More digital health technologies were implemented in clinical services (n &#x3D; 103, 38.7% (103&#x2F;266)) than that in public health response (n &#x3D; 91, 34.2% (91&#x2F;266)). Emergency planning and preparedness had the least self-reported digital health interventions (n &#x3D; 72, 27.1% (72&#x2F;266)). We further identified case studies under each theme in which the wide use of digital health technologies highlighted contextual factors and key enabling mechanisms. Conclusions: The contextual factors and key enabling mechanisms through the use of policy instruments to promote digital health interventions for COVID-19 in China include pathway of policy directives influencing the private sector using a decentralized system, the booming digital health landscape before COVID-19, agility of the public sector in introducing regulatory flexibilities and incentives to mobilize the private sector. © 2021</abstract>

      <abstract>The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is one of the most developed regions in China. This is also a flood-prone area where flood disasters are frequently experienced; the situations between the people–land nexus and the people–water nexus are very complicated. Therefore, the accurate assessment of flood risk is of great significance to regional development. The paper took the YRD urban agglomeration as the research case. The driving force, pressure, state, impact and response (DPSIR) conceptual framework was established to analyze the indexes of flood disasters. The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to screen important indexes of floods risk, and a risk assessment model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network was constructed to evaluate the flood risk level in this region from 2009 to 2018. The risk map showed the I-V level of flood risk in the YRD urban agglomeration from 2016 to 2018 by using the geographic information system (GIS). Further analysis indicated that the indexes such as flood season rainfall, urban impervious area ratio, gross domestic product (GDP) per square kilometer of land, water area ratio, population density and emergency rescue capacity of public administration departments have important influence on flood risk. The flood risk has been increasing in the YRD urban agglomeration during the past ten years under the urbanization background, and economic development status showed a significant positive correlation with flood risks. In addition, there were serious differences in the rising rate of flood risks and the status quo among provinces. There are still a few cities that have stabilized at a better flood-risk level through urban flood control measures from 2016 to 2018. These results were basically in line with the actual situation, which validated the effectiveness of the model. Finally, countermeasures and suggestions for reducing the urban flood risk in the YRD region were proposed, in order to provide decision support for flood control, disaster reduction and emergency management in the YRD region. © 2019 by the authors.

      <abstract>[Purpose] Automated decision-making and algorithmic governance are increasingly implemented in Latin America in order to improve efficiency in public institutions. However, regulatory frameworks are limited, and the uncritical adoption of technological solutions might undermine fundamental rights, especially of marginalized and vulnerable groups. [Methodology] The article explores two cases of automated decision-making in the Colombian public sector from a social justice perspective. It also outlines current debates on the regulation of artificial intelligence and algorithmic governance at the global level. [Findings] The article shows that the techno-optimistic discourse on the improvement of decision-making through the adoption of algorithms and artificial intelligence ignores the implications in terms of fundamental rights. This leads to the adoption of technologies without the necessary transparency and policy debates. [Practical Implications] The outline of current debates in other regions could inform policy debates in Colombia and Latin America. They provide some guidelines on how to prevent some of the most serious pitfalls of automated decision-making in the public sector. [Originality] While most of the debates on automated decision-making focus on the Global North, this article explores two cases from Colombia and discusses the necessary policy debates on algorithmic governance in Latin America. © 2021 Universidade de Brasilia.

      <abstract>Although artificial intelligence (AI; inclusive of machine learning) is
gaining traction supporting climate change projections and impacts,
limited work has used AI to address climate change adaptation. We
identify this gap and highlight the value of AI especially in supporting
complex adaptation choices and implementation. We illustrate how AI can
effectively leverage precise, real-time information in data-scarce
settings. We focus on supervised learning, transfer learning,
reinforcement learning, and multimodal learning to illustrate how
innovative AI methods can enable better-informed choices, tailor
adaptation measures to heterogenous groups and generate effective
synergies and trade-offs. This article is categorized under: Application

      <abstract>The commons concept has evolved in multiple ways after the publication of Ostrom’s seminal work in 1990, which emphasized the evolution of resource management institutions and the usefulness of self-governance. As we move into the 21st century, one of the institutional transformations is catalyzed by the emergence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a techno-economic paradigm shift and the epochal creation of a new online social structure. However, there is a lack of understanding about the impact of ICT on common resource management, particularly in urban settings, that is urban commons. This study presents a systematic literature review of ICT-enabled urban commons with particular attention to its application to climate-related issues such as climate mitigation&#x2F;adaptation in order to improve our collective ability to leverage ICT for building a more sustainable and resilient city. A total of 66 pieces of literature were included in our qualitative synthesis. We analyzed the geographical, categorical, and climate relevance. Subsequently, we used the coupled infrastructure system framework as a system thinking approach to dissect distinct usefulness of ICT-enabled commons in the building of relationships between resource system, resource user, infrastructure, and infrastructure provider to tackle climate-related issues. Our findings identified three key contributions of ICT to innovate climate-resilient solutions: 1) to redefine role of resource user as co-producer, co-designer, and co-monitor; 2) to enable real-time data-driven urban planning; 3) to improve resource efficiency and effectiveness. In other words, in a time of insufficient and limited public resources, the public sector can leverage the power of technology to harness public support and engage non-traditional stakeholders to make cities more sustainable and resilient while allowing policy-making to be big data-driven to tackle new urban problems that cannot be otherwise uncovered without the aid of ICT. The results provide directions to rethink the city based on collective action to diversity modes to govern common resources. © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract>

      <abstract>Orientation: The Fourth Industrial Revolution has transformed modern
society by ushering in the fusion of advances in robotics, the Internet
of Things (IoT), genetic engineering, quantum computing, and artificial
intelligence (AI) among others. AI brings a range of different
technologies and applications to interact with environments that
comprise both the relevant objects and the interaction rules and have
the capacity to process information in a way that resembles intelligent
behaviour. Similarly, artificial intelligence is also being used in the
human resources management (HRM) processes and functions in the public
sector to map sequences to actions.Research purpose: The study explores
the opportunities, challenges, and future prospects of integrating
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Public Sector Human Resource Management
(HRM) in South Africa&#39;s public sector.Motivation for the study: The
study was motivated by the need to examine the dynamics surrounding the
adoption, implementation and operationalisation of the 4IR in the
management of human resources in the SA public sector in this unfolding
dispensation.Research Approach: Data was collected using the extensive
review of written records such as books, journal articles, book chapters
among others which were purposively selected for use in this study. Data
was analysed using content and thematic analysis techniques.Research
Findings: The study established that Artificial Intelligence is
beneficial in the sense that it can improve public service delivery in
South Africa as the HRM personnel is enabled to focus more on the
strategic areas of management by taking over routine tasks, and that it
helps minimize bias in public service recruitment and selection. In
contrast, research on potential challenges has revealed that combining
Artificial Intelligence and Public Sector Human Resource Management may
pose a threat to white-collar jobs.Practical&#x2F; Managerial Implications:
This study may lead to practical applications of AI to support the HR
functions of public sector entities in SA. The public managers are
better informed about the impediments, gaps and opportunities that may
arise from using AI in managing human resources in SA&#39;s public
sector.Contributions: This study contributes to the body of knowledge as
it unpacks and informs the dynamics associated with the implementation
of AI in managing human resources in public sector entities.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article aims at mapping and analyzing the ever increasing recourse by Italian public administration to AI systems. It focuses on three different types of administrations: independent authorities, smart cities and central administrations. For each group of administrations, it asks through which proceedings a decision concerning the use of AI systems is taken, which AI systems are in the process of being experimented and for which purposes, who controls the functioning of the AI. Particular attention is paid to administrative practices and legal and institutional reality. © 2022</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose The revitalization of big data has gained attention in the
public sector. However, such open government data (OGD) is facing major
challenges with respect to data quality and limited use. To solve this
problem, this study analyzes the factors driving the use of OGD from the
perspective of data providers in the public sector.
Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach Using the analytic hierarchy process and
analytic network process methodologies, the importance of the factors
driving the use of big data in the public sector was ranked. In
addition, the different characteristics of tasks among the departments
in a public agency were compared based on expert interviews. Findings
The factors driving OGD use are not only political environment or the
technological environment. The importance of the institutional culture
within the organization increases with the motivation of the data
provider. The priorities of the OGD factors also depend on the
objectives of the department involved. Originality&#x2F;value This study
provides implications for improving the publication of open data by
analyzing the priorities of the factors driving its use from the
perspective of big data providers. It focuses on different perceptions
of the factors valued by public officials in charge of data in
institutions. The results suggest the need to explore officials&#39;
perceptions of value creation in big data fields.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to describe the application of design and
behavior science collectively in refining the government to citizens&#39;
(G2C) cognitive-communication by using artificial intelligence (AI)
artifacts. It investigates the citizens&#39; behavior intention to use AI
cognitive-communication channels in e-government services.
Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach
This study reveals the potential of unification in design and behavior
science paradigms when integrated into AI artifacts in measuring the
constructive outcome of proposed architecture that embraces the
perceived risk and trust in citizens&#39; usage behavior intentions. To
evaluate the practical relevance of design science paradigm, action
research was incorporated by developing an app as an exemplified
scenario.
Findings
The weaknesses of traditional G2C channel communication obliterated by
AI virtual agents. This study proposes a five-layer architecture model
created with citizens-centered design highlighting the improved
relevance for G2C cognitive-communication. The behavior model supports
citizens&#39; usage behavior intentions through trust as a positive
attribute and negative attribute as a perceived risk.
Research limitations&#x2F;implications
This study contributes to the knowledge of design science paradigm
particularly to AI-based cognitive G2C communication. The architecture
serves for deploying virtual agents to automate the public officials for
decision-making processes. The authors have constructed a
cognitive-communication model and have examined the relationships among
the extents of cognitive-communication model. This channel has the
potential to significantly transform G2C cognitive and intelligent
communication.
Practical implications
This cognitive-communication channel has the potential to significantly
transform the communication between government and citizens. Such a
model can be an interest of developers, researchers and government
policymakers in a holistic approach drawn from theory and methods of
both design and behavior science to create a successful communication
scenario.
Social implications
Advances in technology are not without social implications. The study
results can dramatically improve the efficiencies of government
workplaces and can augment the human working. It will help to reduce the
government services discriminations among the citizens and contribute to
society through social inclusion.
Originality&#x2F;value
This study addresses the duality in information system research by first
defining the theoretical framework for G2C cognitive-communication
architecture and then developing a research model drawn upon a citizens&#39;
service usage behavioral theory. It will also contribute to providing
important perceptions of AI practices in the public sector.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study aims to suggest a methodology for measuring the social impact
that knowledge technology can have when it is applied to the public
sector, using the concept of social value. For this purpose it sets four
research questions. First, what are the important concepts that affect
the social value brought by public programmes based on knowledge
technology? Second, what are the important topics that the core concepts
relating to social value come together to form? Third, how are the
important concepts constituting these important topics causally related
to each other? Fourth, how much social value does knowledge technology
bring, and how might the results vary by policy scenario. To answer
these questions, the study utilized text mining analysis, as used in big
data analysis, along with system dynamics analysis to causally analyse
the important topics relating to social value obtained via the analysis,
and to construct the concepts included in these topics.</abstract>

      <abstract>There has been a significantly increased amount of literature on various
aspects of artificial intelligence (AI), but research on AI governance
has been a considerably underdeveloped area. This study proposes a
comprehensive framework for designing AI governance in the public sector
to overcome the limitations of previous studies that primarily dealt
with the fragmentary aspect of AI. Also, we applied the developed
framework to the case of Korea by combining it with the rank-order
survey questions that target experts. This case study presents how to
use the framework and provides insight for other countries.</abstract>

      <abstract>The prevalence of big data is starting to spread across the public and private sectors however, an impediment to its widespread adoption orientates around a lack of appropriate big data analytics (BDA) and resulting skills to exploit the full potential of big data availability. In this paper, we propose a novel BDA to contribute towards this void, using a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) approach that will enhance decision-making thus prioritising IT service procurement in the public sector. This is achieved through the development of decision models that capture the strengths of both data analytics and the established intuitive qualitative approach. By taking advantages of both data analytics and FCM, the proposed approach captures the strength of data-driven decision-making and intuitive model-driven decision modelling. This approach is then validated through a decision-making case regarding IT service procurement in public sector, which is the fundamental step of IT infrastructure supply for publics in a regional government in the Russia federation. The analysis result for the given decision-making problem is then evaluated by decision makers and e-government expertise to confirm the applicability of the proposed BDA. In doing so, demonstrating the value of this approach in contributing towards robust public decision-making regarding IT service procurement. © 2016, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>With the recent global urban issues such as climate change, urbanization, and energy problems, the smart city was proposed as one of the solutions in urban planning. This study introduces the smart city initiatives of South Korea by examining the recent history of smart city policies and their limitations. This case study reflects the experience of one of the countries which thrived to building smart cities as their national key industries to drive economic growth. It also analyzes the trends of the smart city using big data analysis techniques. Although there are obstacles such as economic recession, failing to differentiate from the U-city, low service level than expected smart functionality, We could recognize the current status of the smart city policies in South Korea such as 1) Korean smart city development projects are actively implemented, 2) public consensus suggests that applying advanced technology and the active role of government need, 3) a comprehensive and strategic approach with the integration and application of advanced technologies is required as well, 4) investment by both private and public sectors need to deliver social improvements. This study suggests future direction of smart city polity in South Korea in the conclusion. © Korean Distribution Science Association (KODISA).</abstract>

      <abstract>A spatial distributional analysis of the population of Phase II research
projects funded by the US SBIR program in FY 2020 shows differences
across states in projects focused on artificial intelligence (AI). AI is
a relatively new research field, and this paper contributes to a better
understanding of government support for such research. We find that AI
projects are concentrated in states with complementary AI research
resources available from universities nationally ranked in terms of
their own AI research. To achieve a more diverse spatial distribution of
AI-related technology development, the availability of complementary AI
research resources must be expanded. We suggest that the National
Science Foundation&#39;s National AI Research Institutes represents an
important step in this direction.</abstract>

      <abstract>The recent rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected
to transform how governments work by enhancing the quality of
decision-making. Despite rising expectations and the growing use of AI
by governments, scholarly research on AI applications in public
administration has lagged. In this study, we fill gaps in the current
literature on the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms with a
focus on revenue forecasting by local governments. Specifically, we
explore how different ML models perform on predicting revenue for local
governments and compare the relative performance of revenue forecasting
by traditional forecasters and several ML algorithms. Our findings
reveal that traditional statistical forecasting methods outperform ML
algorithms overall, while one of ML algorithms, KNN, is more effective
in predicting property tax revenue. This result is particularly salient
for public managers in local governments to handle foreseeable fiscal
challenges through more accurate predictions of revenue.</abstract>

      <abstract>The goal of Digital Transformation of the Public Sector is the achievement of a better quality of life for citizens, via a more responsive and transparent administration and governance. By now it is clear that technological innovation, both in terms of computer architectures and software systems, is a crucial component of it, yet not sufficient. Indeed, a cultural, organizational and legal shift in how public organizations operate and relate to the citizens is also required. Nevertheless, computer scientists can play a key role in such a transformation and, given its impact on Society, it is essential to achieve a broader level of awareness of it and involvement in it of those scientific and professional figures. To this end, a technical map specifically designed for computer scientists, but properly placed in the context of the cultural, organizational and legal changes mentioned above, would be highly beneficial. To date, such a map is missing, to the best of our knowledge. The main contribution of this Tutorial is to provide it, together with a guided tour describing which key technological aspects enable and drive such a transformation. More specifically, based on a careful analysis of the available scholarly literature, that does not seem to include any Computer Science textbook material, a model of such a transformation is proposed, together with carefully selected examples incarnating it to show its validity: the cities of Barcelona and Chicago. Finally, a look at the future of this area is also provided.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent public sector reforms have shifted responsibility for public service delivery to local governments, yet little is known about how their management practices or behavior shape performance. This study reports on a comprehensive management survey of district education bureaucrats and their staff that was conducted in every district in Tanzania, and employs flexible machine-learning techniques to identify important management practices associated with learning outcomes. It finds that management practices explain 10 percent of variation in a district&#39;s exam performance. The three management practices most predictive of performance are (a) the frequency of school visits, (b) school and teacher incentives administered by the district manager, and (c) performance review of staff. Although the model is not causal, these findings suggest the importance of incentives and active monitoring to motivate district staff, schools, and teachers, that include frequent monitoring of schools.  © 2022 The Author(s).

      <abstract>Secondary roads represent the largest part of the road network. However, due to the absence of clearly defined edges, presence of occlusions, and differences in widths, monitoring and mapping them represents a great effort for public administration. We believe that recent advancements in machine vision allow the extraction of these types of roads from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and can enable the automation of the mapping operation. In this work, we leverage these advances and propose a deep learning-based solution capable of efficiently extracting the surface area of secondary roads at a large scale. The solution is based on hybrid segmentation models trained with high-resolution remote sensing imagery divided in tiles of 256 × 256 pixels and their correspondent segmentation masks, resulting in increases in performance metrics of 2.7–3.5% when compared to the original architectures. The best performing model achieved Intersection over Union and F1 scores of maximum 0.5790 and 0.7120, respectively, with a minimum loss of 0.4985 and was integrated on a web platform which handles the evaluation of large areas, the association of the semantic predictions with geographical coordinates, the conversion of the tiles’ format and the generation of geotiff results compatible with geospatial databases. © 2020 by the authors.

      <abstract>Nowadays, data are being produced like never before because the use of the Internet of Things, social networks, and communication in general are increasing exponentially. Many of these data, especially those from public administrations, are freely offered using the open data concept where data are published to improve their reutilisation and transparency. Initially, the data involved information that is not updated continuously such as budgets, tourist information, office information, pharmacy information, etc. This kind of information does not change during large periods of time, such as days, weeks or months. However, when open data are produced near to real-time such as air quality sensors or people counters, suitable methodologies and tools are lacking to identify, consume, and analyse them. This work presents a methodology to tackle the analysis of open data sources using Model-Driven Development (MDD) and Complex Event Processing (CEP), which help users to raise the abstraction level utilised to manage and analyse open data sources. That means that users can manage heterogeneous and complex technology by using domain concepts defined by a model that could be used to generate specific code. Thus, this methodology is supported by a domain-specific language (DSL) called OpenData2CEP, which includes a metamodel, a graphical concrete syntax, and a model-to-text transformation to specific platforms, such as complex event processing engines. Finally, the methodology and the DSL have been applied to two near real-time contexts: the analysis of air quality for citizens’ proposals and the analysis of earthquake data. © 2018 by the authors.

      <abstract>In this paper we introduce the concept of &#x60;reviewability&#39; as an
alternative approach to im-proving the accountability of automated
decision-making that involves machine learning systems. In doing so, we
draw on an understanding of automated decision-making as a
socio-technical process, involving both human (organisational) and
technical components, beginning before a decision is made and extending
beyond the decision itself. Although explanations for automated
decisions may be useful in some contexts, they focus more narrowly on
the model and therefore do not provide the information about that
process as a whole that is necessary for many aspects of accountability,
regulatory oversight, and assessments for legal compliance. Drawing on
previous work on the application of administrative law and judicial
review mechanisms to automated decision-making in the public sector, we
argue that breaking down the automated decision-making process into its
technical and organisational components allows us to consider how
appropriate record-keeping and logging mechanisms implemented at each
stage of that process would allow for the process as a whole to be
reviewed. Although significant research is needed to explore how it can
be implemented, we argue that a reviewability framework potentially
offers for a more useful and more holistic form of accountability for
automated decision-making than approaches focused more narrowly on
explanations. (C) 2020 Jennifer Cobbe and Jatinder Singh. Published by

      <abstract>This paper focuses on the spatial variation in the uptake of social security benefits following a large and detrimental exogenous shock. Specifically, we focus on the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and on the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We construct a two-period panel of 66 Territorial Authorities (TAs) of New Zealand (NZ) observed in 2008-09 and 2019-20. We find that, despite the totally different nature of the two shocks, the initial increase in benefit uptake due to the COVID-19 pandemic was of a similar magnitude as that of the GFC, and the spatial pattern was also quite similar. We link the social security data with 146 indicator variables across 15 domains that were obtained from population censuses that were held about 2 years before the two periods. To identify urban characteristics that point to economic resilience, we formulate spatial panel regression models. Additionally, we use machine learning techniques. We find that the most resilient TAs had two years previously: (1) a low unemployment rate; and (2) a large public sector. Additionally, but with less predictive power, we find that TAs had a smaller increase in social security uptake after the shock when they had previously: (3) a high employment rate (or high female labour force participation rate); (4) a smaller proportion of the population stating ethnicities other than NZ European; (5) a smaller proportion of the population living in more deprived area units. We also find that interregional spillovers matter and that there are spatial clusters of resilient regions. © 2023 Australia New Zealand Regional Science Association International Inc. (ANZRSAI).

      <abstract>The purpose of this study was twofold. First, it aimed to determine whether there are differences in Brazilian students&#39; attitudes towards online learning compared to their purpose in seeking for this modality and the localization of the pole where they received face-to-face support. Second, it aimed to identify if Brazilian students&#39; attitudes towards online learning predict their self-perception of performance in the course. A correlational and explanatory quantitative approach was taken through a survey. Data was collected from 593 undergraduate students enrolled in the online public administration course offered by different Brazilian universities. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, group comparison (ANOVA) and multiple linear regression were employed for data analysis. Findings revealed that there are differences between students&#39; attitudes compared to their purpose in seeking for online courses and compared to the localization of the pole where they received face-to-face support. Statistically significant differences were found for Favorable personnel and dispositional aspects (PDA), Negative affects (NA) and Internalization and habituation of use (IHU) attitude dimensions. Furthermore, the study identified predictors of students&#39; self-perception of performance in online courses corresponding to how much students perceive they are accustomed to and capable of taking an online course, represented by the attitude dimension IHU. Results showed significant positive relationship between two attitude dimensions (PDA and PC) and the dimension IHU. In addition, significant negative relationship was found between the biographical variable family income and the dimension IHU. The model explains 40% of the variance of IHU in which PDA represents the strongest predictor. © 2019 Anadolu Universitesi.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online learning is one of the fastest growing trends in educational uses of technology. In this study, an instrument to measure the social attitudes of the Brazilian students based on distance education was developed and validated. The study population consisted of public administration undergraduate students that has been providing by distance education by University of Brasília, in Brazil. The sample of the study consisted of 590 Brazilian students. The scale has 41 items, with total Cronbach alpha coefficient of.94, and reliability coefficient (KMO) of.94. The correlations of each item with total point were between.30 and.79. A factor analysis was run using direct oblimin rotation for construct validity, resulting in 4 factors structure explaining 47.12% of total variability. These factors are &quot;Personnel and Dispositional Aspects&quot;, &quot;Procedural Characteristics&quot;, &quot;Negative Affects&quot; and &quot;Internalization and habituation of usage&quot;. Consequently, findings show that The Brazilian Attitude Scale towards Distance Education (BrazilASTDE) is a valid and reliable instrument. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.</abstract>

      <abstract>Machine-learning algorithms are improving and automating important
functions in medicine, transportation, and business. Government
officials have also started to take notice of the accuracy and speed
that such algorithms provide, increasingly relying on them to aid with
consequential public-sector functions, including tax administration,
regulatory oversight, and benefits administration. Despite
machine-learning algorithms&#39; superior predictive power over conventional
analytic tools, algorithmic forecasts are difficult to understand and
explain. Machine learning&#39;s &#x60;&#x60;black box&#39;&#39; nature has thus raised
concern: Can algorithmic governance be squared with legal principles of
governmental transparency? We analyze this question and conclude that
machine-learning algorithms&#39; relative inscrutability does not pose a
legal barrier to their responsible use by governmental authorities. We
distinguish between principles of &#x60;fishbowl transparency&#39;&#39; and
&#x60;&#x60;reasoned transparency,&#39;&#39; explaining how both are implicated by
algorithmic governance but also showing that neither conception compels
anything close to total transparency. Although machine learning&#39;s
black-box features distinctively implicate notions of reasoned
transparency, legal demands for reason-giving can be satisfied by
explaining an algorithm&#39;s purpose, design, and basic functioning.
Furthermore, new technical advances will only make machine-learning
algorithms increasingly more explainable. Algorithmic governance can
meet both legal and public demands for transparency while still
enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and even potentially legitimacy in
government.</abstract>

      <abstract>Critics raise alarm bells about governmental use of digital algorithms,
charging that they are too complex, inscrutable, and prone to bias. A
realistic assessment of digital algorithms, though, must acknowledge
that government is already driven by algorithms of arguably greater
complexity and potential for abuse: the algorithms implicit in human
decision-making. The human brain operates algorithmically through
complex neural networks. And when humans make collective decisions, they
operate via algorithms too-those reflected in legislative, judicial, and
administrative processes. Yet these human algorithms undeniably fail and
are far from transparent. On an individual level, human decision-making
suffers from memory limitations, fatigue, cognitive biases, and racial
prejudices, among other problems. On an organizational level, humans
succumb to groupthink and free riding, along with other collective
dysfunctionalities. As a result, human decisions will in some cases
prove far more problematic than their digital counterparts. Digital
algorithms, such as machine learning, can improve governmental
performance by facilitating outcomes that are more accurate, timely, and
consistent. Still, when deciding whether to deploy digital algorithms to
perform tasks currently completed by humans, public officials should
proceed with care on a case-by-case basis. They should consider both
whether a particular use would satisfy the basic preconditions for
successful machine learning and whether it would in fact lead to
demonstrable improvements over the status quo. The question about the
future of public administration is not whether digital algorithms are
perfect. Rather, it is a question about what will work better: human
algorithms or digital ones.</abstract>

      <abstract>Education and employment are key aspects of a country&#39;s well-being. Governments expend valuable resources on designing education plans and employment programs. These two aspects are usually analysed separately, although, as they are closely related, considering them together might improve their efficacy. The problem lies, at least in part, in the fact that different public entities manage their own data with their own isolated systems, and do not develop joint educational and employment policies. In order to facilitate working towards this goal, in this manuscript, we make use of Data Engineering, Data Visualization, and Intelligent Data Analytics methods to create a decision support system for the Government of Extremadura. Extremadura is a European Union Objective 1 region in Spain with high rates of unemployment and secondary school drop-out. Data Engineering is used to create a Data Warehouse that unifies the different data sources into a central repository for quick access and control. This allows dealing with the challenge of transforming, processing, storing and accessing the data. Data Visualization techniques are applied to create an interactive dashboard that assists users in analysing and interpreting the data in the Data Warehouse repository. Thus, charts, diagrams, and maps are created specifically to help technical or political decision-makers. Finally, Intelligent Data Analytics techniques are used to incorporate Association Rules into the visualization dashboard. Its goal is to identify associations, relationships, and patterns in data that, at least in plain sight, are not readable or interpretable by humans. It does this by inferring knowledge that humans cannot pick out by themselves. As a result, a complete system was defined and implemented to support public administrations in their decision-making and definition of precise evidence-based policies in the areas of education and employment. In particular, it allows the definition of unified strategies to reduce the unemployment rate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Current debates over digital contact tracing mainly focus on the tools and experiences in the West. China’s health code, while often seen as one of the earliest and most widely adopted apps since the outbreak of COVID-19, has not been studied specifically. This article provides a detailed analysis of the health code, draws comparison with the contact tracing apps developed by Google and Apple, and seeks to understand the specifications and contradictions internal to the health code’s development and deployment in China. Looking at both technical features and the mode and process of its adoption, the article argues that the health code is strictly speaking not a contact tracing tool, but a technology of population control which is integrated in traditional forms of control and facilitates the enhancement of such control. As a technology of ruling the population, rather than the virus as such, the health code also reveals crucial problems in the modernization and informatization of the state governance and public administration. A critique on the health code solely informed by privacy and personal data protection runs the risk of being co-opted by the government and technology companies deploying such tools to expand their surveillance and regulatory power.

      <abstract>Public’s concern about poor animal welfare provided by intensive farming systems has increased over the last decades. This study reviewed the interest of the scientific research on the pain issue in pig production to assess if the societal instances may be a driving force for the research activity. A literature search protocol was set up to identify the peer-reviewed papers published between 1970 and 2017 that covered the topic of ‘pain in pigs’ using Scopus®, database of Elsevier©. One hundred and thirty papers were selected and they were mainly focused on the practice of castration (64%) followed by tail docking (24%). The scientific community first focused on these painful practices as a way to improve production efficiency and quality issues while more recently, due to the increased pressure by the public opinion, turned its interest towards the search of alternative solutions. A text mining analysis on the abstract of the selected papers clearly indicated the effort of the research to explore solutions to alleviate pain. Evocative words of this target were the selected terms ‘pharmacological analgesic’ and ‘anaesthetic treatments’. The text mining highlighted vocalizations as the main pain indicators in pigs as this term was frequently associated to ‘acute stress’. Ethical issues were a minor research topic in the scientific literature on pig breeding but in the short run, they are supposed to become a major subject to justify the acceptance of the modern production systems at the eyes of the consumers. © 2019, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>Innovation scholars have long recognized entrepreneurship is ‘imitative’, whereas the commercialization of novelty is ‘innovative’. Thus they are highly distinctive skill-sets. Entrepreneurship, first, involves optimizing market sentiment for pure profit sometimes to the point of catastrophe and even fraudulence in many markets. These include: payment protection insurance (PPI) to ‘flash crashes’, automotive emission ‘defeat devices’, corporate bribery settlements, social media ‘hacking’, ‘fake news’ and a litany of other infractions and catastrophes. Innovation, by contrast, is more explorative and team-reliant. Even if patenting betrays the hope for commercialization on markets, patented innovation frequently fails. Some academic innovators even profess a preference for prizes over profits. Second, this means that collective ‘bonding’ among entrepreneurs, in the form of claimed ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’, is often based on a single customer platform or as a supplier of a highly specialist type of ‘imitative’ service from identikit pizza chains to ‘me-too’ smartphone apps. Through the latter, fused with artificial intelligence some interactive machine-learning services have long-existed as ‘postsocial’ algorithms serving customers of, for example, investment banks in stock and currency markets. Finally, entrepreneurship is fundamentally competitive, individualistic and non-solidaristic, whereas ‘open innovation’ was born from the practices of ‘open science’ and the collegiate tradition of research. Accordingly, ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’ can display more closure than RIS set-ups. This special issue explores aspects of these ecosystem platforms and their implications for emergent forms of urban and regional evolution in the near and nearly present future. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the
literature on open data in three ways. The first is to develop a
descriptive analysis of journals and authors to identify the knowledge
areas in which open data are applied. The second is to analyse the
conceptual structure of the field using a bibliometric technique. The
co-word analysis enabled us to create a map of the main themes that have
been studied, identifying their importance and relevance. These themes
were analysed and grouped. The third is to propose future research
trends. According to our results, the main knowledge areas are
Engineering, Health, Public Administration, Management and Education.
The main themes are big data, open-linked data and data reuse. Finally,
several research questions are proposed according to knowledge area and
theme.</abstract>

      <abstract>Infectious and contagious diseases represent a major challenge for health systems worldwide, either in private or public sectors. More recently, with the increase in cases related to these problems, combined with the recent global pandemic of COVID-19, the need to study strategies to treat these health disturbs is even more latent. Big Data, as well as Big Data Analytics techniques, have been addressed in this context with the possibility of predicting, mapping, tracking, monitoring, and raising awareness about these epidemics and pandemics. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify how BDA can help in cases of pandemics and epidemics. To achieve this purpose, a systematic review of literature was carried out using the methodology Methodi Ordinatio. The rigorous search resulted in a portfolio of 45 articles, retrived from scientific databases. For the collection and analysis of data, the softwares NVivo 12 and VOSviewer were used. The content analysis sought to identify how Big Data and Big Data Analytics can help fighting epidemics and pandemics. The types and sources of data used in cases of previous epidemics and pandemics were identified, as well as techniques for treating these data. The results showed that the main sources of data come from social media and Internet search engines. The most common techniques for analyzing these data involve the use of statistics, such as correlation and regression, combined with other techniques. Results shows that there is a fruitiful field of study to be explored by both areas, Big Data and Health. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic has generated new needs due to the associated
health risks and, more specifically, its rapid infection rate.
Prevention measures to avoid contagions in indoor spaces, especially in
office and public buildings (e.g., hospitals, public administration,
educational cen-tres, etc.), have led to the need for adequate
ventilation to dilute the possible concentration of the virus. This
article presents our contribution to this new challenge, namely the
Ventilation Early Warning System (VEWS) which has aims to adapt the
operation of the current Heating, Venti-lating and Air Conditioning
(HVAC) systems to the ventilation needs of diaphanous workspaces, based
on a Smart Campus Digital Twin (SCDT) framework approach, while
maintaining sus-tainability. Different technologies such as the Internet
of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithms are combined to collect and integrate
monitoring data (historical records, real-time information, and
location-related patterns) to carry out forecasting simulations in this
digital twin. The generated outputs serve to assist facility managers in
their building governance, considering the appropriate application of
health mea-sures to reduce the risk of coronavirus contagion in
combination with sustainability criteria. The article also provides the
results of the implementation of the VEWS in a university workspace as a
case study. Its application has made it possible to detect and warn of
inadequate ventilation situations for the daily flow of people in the
different controlled zones.</abstract>

      <abstract>Absenteeism affects state-owned companies who are obliged to undertake
strategies to prevent it, be efficient and conduct effective human
resource (HR) management. This paper aims to understand the reasons for
Public Administration Employees&#39; (PAE) absenteeism and predict future
employee absences. Data from 17,600 PAE from seven public databases
regarding their 2016 absences was collected, and the Recency, Frequency
and Monetary (RFM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used
for modeling the absence duration, backed up with a 10-fold
cross-validation scheme. Results revealed that the worker profile is
less relevant than the absence characteristics. The most concerning
employee profile was uncovered, and a set of scenarios is provided
regarding the expected days of absence in the future for each scenario.
The veracity of the absence motives could not be proven and thus are
totally reliable. In addition, the number of records of one absence day
was disproportionate to the other records. The findings are of value to
the Human Capital Management department in order to support their
decisions regarding the allocation of workers and productivity
management and use these valuable insights in the recruitment process.
Until now, little has been known concerning the characteristics that
affect PAE absenteeism, therefore enriching the necessity for further
understanding of this matter in this particular.</abstract>

      <abstract>Current advancements in Information Technologies (IT) lead organizations to pursue high business value and competitive advantages through the collection, storage, processing and analysis of huge amounts of heterogonous data, generated at ever increasing rates. Datadriven organizations are often seen as environments wherein the analysis and understanding of products, people and transactions are of major relevance. Big Data, mainly defined as data with high volume, variety and velocity, creating severe limitations in traditional technologies, promises to leverage smarter insights based on challenging and more granular data sources, increasingly demanding emergent skills from data scientists to revolutionize business products, processes and services. The concept gained significant notoriety during the last years, since many business areas can benefit from this phenomenon, such as healthcare, public sector, retail, manufacturing and modern cities. Big Data as a research topic faces innumerous challenges, from the ambiguity and lack of common approaches to the need of significant organizational changes. Therefore, research on Big Data is relevant to assure that organizations have rigorously justified proofs that emergent techniques and technologies can help them making progress in data-driven business contexts. This work presents a state-of-the-art literature review in Big Data, including its current relevance, definition, techniques and technologies, while highlighting several research challenges in this field. Furthermore, this work also provides relevant rules for modelling databases in Big Data environments, which can be used to convert relational data models into column-oriented data models.</abstract>

      <abstract>Investigating how the public sector adopts technologies to process and
analyze very large datasets is crucial for understanding governance in
the digital age. The authors of this article examine a large government
agency, the United States Border Patrol (USBP), an organization that is
in the early phases of building big data capabilities. They argue the
wide-scale adoption of big data analytics will require trial-and-error
processes coordinated by organizational leadership in partnership with
front-line employees who make the technology relevant to their needs in
the field. Absent engagement from both levels, organizations like USBP
that face significant barriers to adoption (e.g., limited data science
expertise) will struggle to leverage data at scale. The authors also
extend the literature on big data in the public sector and provide a
rich description of how factors, such as organizational leadership and
resources, impact the innovation process.</abstract>

      <abstract>Social media adoption by public administrations is usually related to
the promotion of transparency, participation and collaboration. However,
less attention has been paid to the utilisation of social media for
public service delivery. Hence, this paper explores what strategies of
use local governments are employing to create content on social media.
To do so, our study re-elaborates a well-known interpretative framework
of social media interactions in the public sector, regarding three
categories: providing information, citizen interaction and public
service delivery. By analysing Twitter data through machine-learning
automated natural language processing, we test the framework studying
posted content from a leading group of European city councils. Our
conclusions confirm the utilisation of social media to provide
institutional information or foster interactions with citizens. At the
same time, European local governments are also starting to use social
media for public service delivery.</abstract>

      <abstract>More and more decisions are delegated to Machine Learning (ML) and
automatic decision systems recently. Despite initial misconceptions
considering these systems unbiased and fair, recent cases such as racist
algorithms being used to inform parole decisions in the US, low-income
neighborhood&#39;s targeted with high-interest loans and low credit scores,
and women being undervalued by online marketing, fueled public distrust
in machine learning. This poses a significant challenge to the adoption
of ML by companies or public sector organisations, despite ML having the
potential to lead to significant reductions in cost and more efficient
decisions, and is motivating research in the area of algorithmic
fairness and fair ML. Much of that research is aimed at providing
detailed statistics, metrics and algorithms which are difficult to
interpret and use by someone without technical skills. This paper tries
to bridge the gap between lay users and fairness metrics by using
simpler notions and concepts to represent and reason about digital
discrimination. In particular, we use norms as an abstraction to
communicate situations that may lead to algorithms committing
discrimination. In particular, we formalise non-discrimination norms in
the context of ML systems and propose an algorithm to attest whether ML
systems violate these norms.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most prominent topics
in public policy and administration studies over the last years. Despite
the attention to AI in this field isn&#39;t entirely new, the universality
of these group of technologies has radically increased the attention of
scholars around the globe. This expansion of AI in the public sector
entails the exploration of renovated foundations of analysis, not only
to understand the novelty of these technologies, but also to connect
these processes of adoption and implementation with other debates in
public policy and administration. To do so, in this article we debate
the need of an analytical framework of AI in the public sector based on
the three levels of public administration: macro, meso, and micro. Also,
we review the state-of-the-art in the field using the articles presented
in the special issue on Artificial Intelligence and Public
Administration: Actors, Governance, and Policy. Form here, we propose
studying AI using a combination of macro, meso, and micro levels of
public administration. We assume this will help to broadly apprehend how
and why people, policies, and institutions interrelate with AI in public
sector settings, and which effects can be expected from these processes
in public administration.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article presents a study about artificial intelligence (AI) policy based on the perceptions, expectations, and challenges&#x2F;opportunities given by chief information officers (CIOs). In general, publications about AI in the public sector relies on experiences, cases, ideas, and results from the private sector. Our study stands out from the need of defining a distinctive approach to AI in the public sector, gathering primary (and comparative) data from different countries, and assessing the key role of CIOs to frame federal&#x2F;national AI policies and strategies. This article reports three research questions, including three dimensions of analysis: (1) perceptions regarding to the concept of AI in the public sector; (2) expectations about the development of AI in the public sector; and, (3) challenges and opportunities of AI in the public sector. This exploratory study presents the results of a survey administered to federal&#x2F;national ministerial government CIOs in ministries of Mexico and Spain. Our descriptive statistical (and exploratory) analysis provides an overall approach to our dimensions, exploratory answering the research questions of the study. Our data supports the existence of different governance models and policy priorities in different countries. Also, these results might inform research in this same area and will help senior officials to assess the national AI policies actually in process of design and implementation in different national&#x2F;federal, regional&#x2F;state, and local&#x2F;municipal contexts. © This paper is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</abstract>

      <abstract>Tourism revenues have important implications for tourism countries in terms of management of tourism-related policies. In order to accurately direct production planning, pricing, promotion and strategic marketing programs, labor and capital resources, accurate and reliable forecasts are needed. Forecasting the developments in tourism with scientific basis methods is an important guide for central and local public administration programs and tourism operators. When reviewing the literature, comparative studies on modeling and forecasting tourism revenues using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are limited and this paper aims to fill this gap. Based on the gap seen in the literature, the purpose of this study is to develop the optimal forecasting model that yields the highest accuracy when comparing the performances of three different methods namely Exponential Smoothing, Box-Jenkins and ANNs for forecasting Turkey&#39;s tourism revenues. Forecasting performances of the models were measured by MAPE statistics. As a result of the analyses performed, it was found that ANN Model with [4:5:1] architecture was the best one among the all models applied in this study. © 2020 Akdeniz University Publishing House.

      <abstract>The objective of this work is to describe the knowledge discovery
process (KDD) and use it in this huge volume of data currently generated
by social networks, robots and different organizational systems. The
intention is to demonstrate the use of data mining without going into
the deeper details of computationally applicable algorithms, but
subsidize with theoretical tools, public servers and managers, so that
they can understand the tasks and techniques of data mining and enable
supporting the implementation and application of these techniques in
their daily lives in order to increase effectiveness, scope and
perspective of their activities. A qualitative research was carried out
to analyze applications related to data mining found in the literature.
As a result, a range of application possibilities for data mining
techniques was identified, considering different contexts in federal
public administration agencies.</abstract>

      <abstract>Indoor environmental quality plays a crucial role in determining the overall quality of life. This study aims to develop a design optimization approach for the floor plan of public housing buildings with modular flat design in Hong Kong, with focus on enhancing natural ventilation, reducing noise levels, and improve daylighting conditions. The evaluation of these environmental factors was conducted using deep neural network models and a mathematically based Calculation of Road Traffic Noise model. A general floor plan representation was developed for three- and four-winged structures of public housing buildings. An optimization approach utilizing Bayesian optimization was applied to three studied cases: Hung Shing House, Hung Hei House, and Cheung Tai House. The optimization process resulted in an average 41.5 % improvement in average natural ventilation rate. The optimized building shapes effectively served as noise barriers, leading to an average reduction of 20 % in average noise levels. The existing window configurations of each unit type under the modular flat design already provided sufficient daylighting, resulting in only a minor improvement from the optimization process. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Featured Application: The main outcome and procedure described in this paper aim to equip Public Administrations with a tool that can provide on-demand support. Bathymetric information has become essential to help maintain and operate coastal zones. Traditional in situ bathymetry mapping using echo sounders is inefficient in shallow waters and operates at a high logistical cost. On the other hand, lidar mapping provides an efficient means of mapping coastal areas. However, this comes at a high acquisition cost as well. In comparison, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) provides a more cost-effective way of mapping coastal regions, albeit at a lower resolution. This work utilises all three of these methods collectively, to obtain accurate bathymetric depth data of two pocket beaches, Golden Bay and Għajn Tuffieħa, located in the northwestern region of Malta. Using the Google Earth Engine platform, together with Sentinel-2 data and collected in situ measurements, an empirical pre-processing workflow for estimating SDB was developed. Four different machine learning algorithms which produced differing depth accuracies by calibrating SDBs with those derived from alternative techniques were tested. Thus, this study provides an insight into the depth accuracy that can be achieved for shallow coastal regions using SDB techniques. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Stream and river monitoring have an influential role in agriculture, the fishing industry, land surveillance, the oil and gas industry, etc. Recognizing sudden changes in the behavior of streamflow could also provide tremendous insight for decision-making and administration purposes. The primary purpose of this study is to offer a new robust Regime Shift Change Detection (RSCD) algorithm which can identify periods and regime changes without any assumptions regarding the length of these periods. A regime shift algorithm using two different refined method approaches is proposed in this article. The RSCD with Relative Difference (RSCD-RD) and RSCD with Growth Rate (RSCD-GR) are the two main specializations of this regime shift algorithm. We compared these two specializations on train and test datasets and commented on the advantages and each specialization. RSCD-GR and RSCD-RD were equally effective in detecting regime changes when thresholds were pinpointed for each station and season. However, RSCD-RD outperformed RSCD-GR when general thresholds were used for cold and warm months. A strength of RSCD-GR is the ability to investigate newly observed data separately, while RSCD-RD may require re-investigation of historical data in some cases. A regime change was detected in the monthly streamflow data of the Athabasca River at Athabasca (07BE001) in May 2007, while no such change was observed in the monthly streamflow data of the Athabasca River below Fort McMurray (07DA001). The discrepancy could be attributed to factors such as the clarity of the river water from Saskatchewan or the utilization of industrial water. Additional investigation might be required to determine the underlying causes. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>In an age when open access to law enforcement files and judicial
documents can erode individual privacy and confidentiality, miscreants
can abuse this open access to personal information for blackmail,
misinformation, and even social engineering. Yet, limiting access to law
enforcement and court cases is a freedom-of-information violation.To
address this tension, this collaborative action-research-based teaching
case exemplifies how Italy&#39;s Corte dei Conti (Court of Auditors) used
artificial intelligence in the automated deidentification and
anonymization of court documents in Italy&#39;s public sector.This teaching
case is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students learning about
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., ChatGPT)
evolution, development, and operations. The case will help students
learn the origin and evolution of AI transformer models and
architectures, and discusses the GiusBERTo operation and process,
highlighting opportunities and challenges. GiusBERTo, Italy&#39;s custom-AI
model, offers an innovative approach that walks a tightrope between
anonymizing Italy&#39;s judicial court documents without sacrificing context
or information loss. The case ends with a series of questions,
challenges, and potential for LLMs in data anonymization.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article aims to address the potential and possible risks in
adopting technologies in predictive policing and to evaluate the
possibilities of conducting decision-making processes by the Public
Administration in defining the use of Big Data in public security. In
other words, we intend to answer the following question: what are the
risks and opportunities that the collection of a large set of data,
established by algorithms, about behavior patterns and hidden
understandings, offer? By looking at the experiences of other countries
and the debates currently taking place in Brazil, we seek to indicate
some paths for a constitutionally adequate discussion of the matter. The
methodology adopted is bibliographic and the objective of the research
carried out is to contribute to the debate concerning the use of
technology for state decision-making.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by the
public administration. Through an approach that brings together
bibliographic, documentary and empirical analysis, a questionnaire was
applied to public servants and employees with the intention of mapping
their perception of the mentioned problem. The conclusions of this work
have limitations from the point of view of external validation, since
the number of respondents that make up the sample is small. Thus, the
findings should be understood more as indicative of a punctual portrait
of the perception of public servants and employees about AI than as
generalizable conclusions to the public service in a broad way. The main
empirical findings corroborate the growing perception of gains in
efficiency and agility in the development of Administration activities
and show the lack of preparation of public servants and employees to
deal with these digital changes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Smart lighting systems have become increasingly popular in several public sectors because of trends toward urbanization and intelligent technologies. In this study, we designed and implemented a web application platform to explore and monitor data acquired from lighting devices at Thammasat University (Rangsit Campus, Thailand). The platform provides a convenient interface for administrative and operative staff to monitor, control, and collect data from sensors installed on campus in real time for creating geographically specific big data. Platform development focuses on both back- and front-end applications to allow a seamless process for recording and displaying data from interconnected devices. Responsible persons can interact with devices and acquire data effortlessly, minimizing workforce and human error. The collected data were analyzed using an exploratory data analysis process. Missing data behavior caused by system outages was also investigated. © The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper introduces systems theory and system safety concepts to ongoing academic debates about the safety of Machine Learning (ML) systems in the public sector. In particular, we analyze the risk factors of ML systems and their respective institutional context, which impact the ability to control such systems. We use interview data to abductively show what risk factors of such systems are present in public professionals&#39; perceptions and what factors are expected based on systems theory but are missing. Based on the hypothesis that ML systems are best addressed with a systems theory lens, we argue that the missing factors deserve greater attention in ongoing efforts to address ML systems safety. These factors include the explication of safety goals and constraints, the inclusion of systemic factors in system design, the development of safety control structures, and the tendency of ML systems to migrate towards higher risk. Our observations support the hypothesis that ML systems can be best regarded through a systems theory lens. Therefore, we conclude that system safety concepts can be useful aids for policymakers who aim to improve ML system safety. © 2024</abstract>

      <abstract>Objectives: Public service motivation refers to the idea of commitment to the public service, pursuit of the public interest, and the desire to perform work that is worthwhile to society. This study investigates how challenge stress and hindrance stress influence job performance among healthcare workers in Chinese public hospitals. It has also examined the mediating effect of public service motivation. Methods: Data of 1594 healthcare workers were obtained from typical public hospitals in eastern, central, and western China. To test our hypotheses, we used descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, structural equation modeling, and subgroup analysis to investigate the sample. Results: Challenge stress and hindrance stress were strongly correlated among healthcare workers in Chinese public hospitals (β &#x3D; 0.59; p &lt; 0.001). Challenge stress was significantly positively associated with public service motivation (β &#x3D; 0.14; p &lt; 0.001) and job performance (β &#x3D; 0.13; p &lt; 0.001). Hindrance stress was significantly negatively associated with public service motivation (β &#x3D; - 0.27; p &lt; 0.001) and job performance (β &#x3D; - 0.08; p &lt; 0.05). Public service motivation was directly positively associated with job performance (β &#x3D; 0.58; p &lt; 0.001), and it indirectly mediated the association between job stress and job performance. Conclusions: This study provides important empirical evidence on the effects of job stress and public service motivation on job performance among healthcare workers in Chinese public hospitals. Job performance may be raised by limiting hindrance stress, which provides moderate challenge stress and increases public service motivation. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly popular in the public
sector to improve the cost-efficiency of service delivery. One example
is AI-based profiling models in public employment services (PES), which
predict a jobseeker&#39;s probability of finding work and are used to
segment jobseekers in groups. Profiling models hold the potential to
improve identification of jobseekers at-risk of becoming long-term
unemployed, but also induce discrimination. Using a recently developed
AI-based profiling model of the Flemish PES, we assess to what extent
AI-based profiling &#x60;discriminates&#39; against jobseekers of foreign origin
compared to traditional rule-based profiling approaches. At a maximum
level of accuracy, jobseekers of foreign origin who ultimately find a
job are 2.6 times more likely to be misclassified as &#x60;high-risk&#39;
jobseekers. We argue that it is critical that policymakers and
caseworkers understand the inherent trade-offs of profiling models, and
consider the limitations when integrating these models in daily
operations. We develop a graphical tool to visualize the accuracy-equity
trade-off in order to facilitate policy discussions.</abstract>

      <abstract>The inclusion of efficiency among the principles governing the Public Administration represented the consecration of the specific duty of the public administrator to carry out his duties with promptness, perfection, and professional performance. However, factors such as functional deficits and financial resources prevent the public manager from making administrative efficiency consolidate and should seek alternatives to overcome such deficiencies. In view of this, the work-orientation problem is developed, which consists in analysing how the use of Artificial Intelligence can contribute to the effectiveness of the principle of efficiency in Public Administration. Initially, the principle of efficiency of Public Administration will be analysed. Next, considerations will be woven about Artificial Intelligence. Finally, we will study some cases in which Artificial Intelligence is being used by public agencies, to prove the hypothesis, that is, that the use of artificial intelligence is an important mechanism for the embodiment of administrative efficiency. © (2023), (Universidade Federal de Vicosa).

      <abstract>In this essay, we consider the role of Big Data in the public sector. Motivating our work is the recognition that Big Data is still in its infancy and many important questions regarding the true value of Big Data remain unanswered. The question we consider is as follows: What are the limits, or potential, of Big Data in the public sector? By reviewing the literature and summarizing insights from a series of interviews from public sector Chief Information Officers (CIOs), we offer a scholarly foundation for both practitioners and researchers interested in understanding Big Data in the public sector. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) the magic word has changed our personal as well as working life. Owing to its prospective features, adoption of AI is being treated as an important one in the industry 4.0. Since its emergence, it brings lot of opportunities to different industries as well as challenges. Thus a lot of AI powered technologies have been developed with potential to improve the economy by improving the quality of life significantly. In India, AI contributes a lot in different spheres of the economy such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services sector like finance, transportation, public administration and defence. And thus it considerably drives GDP growth. As a result, the gains from AI are also expected to have a magnified effect on the above sectors. Thus, in the globalization era, no country can isolate itself from the impact of the advances in technology. However, the benefits can be maximized and losses can be minimized by putting necessary infrastructure and policy in place. Though several countries have decided their strategy for AI, India has not yet formulated its strategy. Hence, the present article reviews the relevance of AI in Indian industries at present and to the future and by the way it suggests way forward for India. © IAEME Publication.</abstract>

      <abstract>Financial Management Information Systems (FMIS) are essential for
efficient and transparent management of financial resources in the
public sector. Due to the scarcity of publications on this topic in
Colombia, this article aims to provide a contribution to academia and
professionals who work in public finance by examining the importance of
systems such as SIIF, CHIP, SIRECI, ePICO, SIA Observa, the DNP
Investment Map, and the new PIIP platform, among others. Topics such as
Smart Public Management (SPM), digital government, the fight against
corruption, interoperability, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence
(AI) and public marketing are also addressed. The research used an
interpretative perspective, based on a theoretical, documentary,
descriptive and purposeful type. It also used a qualitative and
quantitative approach, which included the application of a survey as an
instrument of data collection. At the end of the article, the challenge
of improving the interoperability and security of FMIS in the Colombian
State is raised, highlighting the importance of training officials in
information and communication technologies (ICT), as well as promoting
websites and platforms related to state public finances to strengthen
transparency and encourage citizen participation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Automation is not new, but the possibilities for automation have been
significantly expanded in recent years through advancements in
artificial intelligence. Such technologies may drive some improvements,
although they are not without risk and we lack a solid evidence base to
suggest the implications of these changes. Framing AI supported
automation as &#x60;technological outsourcing&#39;, we draw on the
well-established outsourcing literature to derive lessons about the
possible implications of public sector automation and outline some
principles that agencies can use to assist in their decision-making
about whether to invest in automation of particular processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Publishing in journals is crucial in the creation of knowledge within the public administration field and the career advancements of individuals. Each year, more articles enter journal publishing systems, and it is becoming more difficult and time consuming for editors to secure reviewers. A range of technological applications have been developed that apply automation techniques to various aspects of the peer review process and these are explored in this paper. We find some potentially promising applications in terms of assessing aspects of quality and in identifying potential reviewers. The replacement of humans in review processes is less clear cut and there are dangers in exacerbating inequities within the field. The value of peer review is particularly important for early career researchers and building a community of scholarship in the public administration field. It is crucial we recognise this and do not lose positives of peer review processes to address some of the issues currently experienced. Points for practitioners: Academic journals help create knowledge within the field of public administration and play a role in career advancement of individual academics. Yet, there are a number of well-established challenges with peer review processes. Recent advancements in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence offer the potential to automate some processes associated with peer review. Several automation processes are already available and in use around some areas of peer review processes and these are explored in this paper. But it is unlikely that automation will replace humans in peer review processes, and it is important that the public administration community revisits the importance of these processes and considers how these are valued and rewarded. © 2023 The Authors.

      <abstract>This is an effort to analyze the reaction of stock prices of Indian public and private banks listed in NSE and BSE to the announcement of seven best case news events. Several recent studies have analyzed the correlation between stock prices and news announcements; however, there is no evidence on how private and public sector Indian bank stocks react to important news events independently. We examine these features by concentrating on a sample of banking and government news events. We classify these news events to create a group of negative and a group of positive tone of announcements (sentiments). The statistical results show that the negative banking news announcements had a one-month impact on private banks, with statistically significant negative mean CARs. However, with highly statistically substantial negative mean CARs, the influence of the negative banking news announcements on public banks was observed for two months after the news was published. Furthermore, the influence of the positive banking news on private banks persisted a month after the news was published. Positive banking news events had an influence on public banks for five days after they were published. The study concludes that public bank stocks react more to negative news announcements than positive news announcements in the same manner as the sentimental polarity of the news announcements as compared to private bank stocks. First, we retrieved the news articles published in prominent online financial news portals between 2017 and 2020, and the seven major news events were extracted and classified using multi-class text classification. The Random Forest classifier produced a significant accuracy of 94% with pre-trained embeddings of DistilBERT, a neural network model, which outperformed the traditional feature representation technique, TF-IDF. The training data for the classifier were balanced using the SMOTE sampling technique. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>In recent decades, public service provision has become increasingly
digitalized. However, while digitalization and artificial intelligence
holds many promises, there is surprisingly little causal evidence on how
it affects the employees who provide such services in the frontline.
Based on cognitive and social psychological theories, we argue that IT
projects can increase employees&#39; cynicism towards change and change
fatigue. In liaison with a Danish unemployment insurance fund, we test
our hypotheses in a pre-registered randomized controlled trial that
introduced an algorithmic decision-making support tool to underpin the
counselling of newly unemployed clients. We do not find evidence that
implementation of this tool resulted in negative employee outcomes.
However, exploratory analyses indicate that this conclusion may mask
smaller or heterogenous effects depending on employees&#39; years of service
with the insurance fund. We end the paper by discussing the implications
of organizational change in the public sector.</abstract>

      <abstract>Multiple terms describe Indigenous peoples’ creative expressions, including “Indigenous knowledge” (IK), “traditional ecological knowledge” (TEK), “traditional knowledge” (TK), and increasingly, “Indigenous data” (ID). Variation in terms contributes to disciplinary divides, challenges in organizing and fĳinding prior studies about Indigenous peoples’ creative expressions, and intellectually divergent chains of reference. The authors applied a decolonial, digital, feminist, ethics-of-care approach to citation analysis of records about Indigenous peoples knowledge and data, including network analyses of author-generated keywords and research areas, and content analysis of peer-reviewed studies about ID. Results reveal ambiguous uses of the term “Indigenous data”; the influence of ecology and environmental studies in research areas and topics associated with IK, TEK, and TK; and the influence of public administration and governance studies in research areas and topics associated with ID studies. Researchers of ID would benefĳit from applying a more nuanced and robust vocabulary, one informed by studies of IK, TEK, and TK. Researchers of TEK and TK would benefĳit from the more people-centered approaches of IK. Researchers and systems designers who work with data sets can practice relational accountability by centering the Indigenous peoples from whom observations are sourced, combining narrative methodologies with computational methods to sustain the holism favored by Indigenous science and the relationality of Indigenous peoples. © 2020 Wayne State University Press.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper presents Romania&#39;s level of digitalization and the
possibility and opportunity of integrating artificial intelligence (AI)
into e-Government applications. After an initial presentation of the
digitization status at national level, focusing on the role of Internet
domains in the digital transformation, Romania&#39;s position in the latest
European publication of DESI (Digital Economy and Society Index) ranking
is analysed. After identifying the directions that can be followed in
Romania to improve the level of digitization, the article focuses in
detail on the development and expansion of e-Government applications and
especially it highlights the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
these applications. After some remarks on the ethics for policy makers
in the AI-centric approach, issues related to the development of the
necessary capabilities for the public sector are addressed and the most
important challenges of AI for smart governing are identified.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article examines the model of digital era governance (DEG) in the
light of the latest-wave of data-driven technologies, such as data
science methodologies and artificial intelligence (labelled here DSAI).
It identifies four key top-level macro-themes through which digital
changes in response to these developments may be investigated. First,
the capability to store and analyse large quantities of digital data
obviates the need for data &#x60;compression&#39; that characterises
Weberian-model bureaucracies, and facilitates data de-compression in
data-intensive information regimes, where the capabilities of public
agencies and civil society are both enhanced. Second, the increasing
capability of robotic devices have expanded the range of tasks that
machines extending or substituting workers&#39; capabilities can perform,
with implications for a reshaping of state organisation. Third, DSAI
technologies allow new options for partitioning state functions in ways
that can maximise organisational productivity, in an &#x60;intelligent
centre, devolved delivery&#39; model within vertical policy sectors. Fourth,
within each tier of government, DSAI technologies offer new
possibilities for &#x60;administrative holism&#39; - the horizontal allocation of
power and functions between organisations, through state integration,
common capacity and needs-based joining-up of services. Together, these
four themes comprise a third wave of DEG changes, suggesting important
administrative choices to be made regarding information regimes, state
organisation, functional allocation and outsourcing arrangements, as
well as a long-term research agenda for public administration, requiring
extensive and detailed analysis.</abstract>

      <abstract>Within long-lived public sector bureaucracies, the organizational
cultures developed by administrative elites have strong filtering and
focusing effects on the kinds of technological changes adopted,
especially in the modern era. Normally seen as very slow-moving and hard
to alter, senior officials&#39; attitudes towards digital changes have
recently begun to alter in more substantial ways in Australia. We review
first a considerable reappraisal of the priority given to digital
changes by top public service managers. This cultural shift has followed
on from tech-lead disruptive societal changes affecting most areas of
government now, and from the rise of global-scaled ICT corporations to
become key management exemplars for officials. Second, we look at the
chequered history of political leaders&#39; interventions to speed up
digital change, showing that in the period 2015-19 Australia witnessed
both the initial power and later limits of such involvement. Finally, we
consider Australia&#39;s recent experience with big data&#x2F; artificial
intelligence (BDAI), a key area of technological change for public
service officials, but one that in a liberal democracy can also easily
spark public resistance to their plans.</abstract>

      <abstract>As far back as the industrial revolution, significant development in
technical innovation has succeeded in transforming numerous manual tasks
and processes that had been in existence for decades where humans had
reached the limits of physical capacity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
offers this same transformative potential for the augmentation and
potential replacement of human tasks and activities within a wide range
of industrial, intellectual and social applications. The pace of change
for this new AI technological age is staggering, with new breakthroughs
in algorithmic machine learning and autonomous decision-making,
engendering new opportunities for continued innovation. The impact of AI
could be significant, with industries ranging from: finance, healthcare,
manufacturing, retail, supply chain, logistics and utilities, all
potentially disrupted by the onset of AI technologies. The study brings
together the collective insight from a number of leading expert
contributors to highlight the significant opportunities, realistic
assessment of impact, challenges and potential research agenda posed by
the rapid emergence of AI within a number of domains: business and
management, government, public sector, and science and technology. This
research offers significant and timely insight to AI technology and its
impact on the future of industry and society in general, whilst
recognising the societal and industrial influence on pace and direction
of AI development.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper is aimed at balancing the interests of business and society in the digital economy, to reduce the social risks of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The goal of this paper is to study the experience and prospects of the humanisation of AI through the improvement of the practice of corporate social responsibility in Russia. By the example of the experience of Russian regions in 2021, we use econometric modelling to prove that the digital regional economy has a large potential in the sphere of humanisation of AI. The potential for the humanisation of AI in the digital economy of Russian regions is determined by responsible innovations, responsible production and logistics, as well as responsible marketing and sales, which contribute to the implementation of SDGs 9–12. The theoretical significance of the paper lies in its presenting smart region as a socio-economic environment for the humanisation of AI. The scientific novelty of the paper lies in its offering a new—meso-level—view of the humanisation of AI. The advantages of the new view include, first, consideration of socio-economic conditions for the humanisation of AI in a region; second, the most precise identification and correct measuring of the consequences of humanisation of AI for the quality of life in a region. The practical significance of the research results consists in the fact that the new proposed approach to the humanisation of AI, which implies public administration of this process at the level of a region, allows accelerating the considered process. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>Service providers compose services in service chains that require deep integration of core operational information systems across organizations. Additionally, advanced analytics inform data-driven decision-making in corresponding AI-enabled business processes in today’s complex environments. However, individual partner engagements with service consumers and providers often entail individually negotiated, highly customized Service Level Agreements (SLAs) comprising engagement-specific metrics that semantically differ from general KPIs utilized on a broader operational (i.e., cross-client) level. Furthermore, the number of unique SLAs to be managed increases with the size of such service chains. The resulting complexity pushes large organizations to employ dedicated SLA management systems, but such ‘siloed’ approaches make it difficult to leverage insights from SLA evaluations and predictions for decision-making in core business processes, and vice versa. Consequently, simultaneous optimization for both global operational process efficiency and engagement-specific SLA compliance is hampered. To address these shortcomings, we propose our vision of supplying online, AI-supported SLA analytics to data-driven, intelligent core workflows of the enterprise and discuss current research challenges arising from this vision. Exemplified by two scenarios derived from real use cases in industry and public administration, we demonstrate the need for improved semantic alignment of heavily customized SLAs with AI-enabled operational systems. Moreover, we discuss specific challenges of prescriptive SLA analytics under multi-engagement SLA awareness and how the dual role of AI in such scenarios demands bidirectional data exchange between operational processes and SLA management. Finally, we discuss the implications of federating AI-supported SLA analytics across organizations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>How will artificial intelligence (Al) transform government? Stemming
from a major study commissioned by the Administrative Conference of the
United States (ACUS), we highlight the promise and trajectory of
algorithmic tools used by federal agencies to perform the work of
governance. Moving past the abstract mappings of transparency measures
and regulatory mechanisms that pervade the current algorithmic
accountability literature, our analysis centers around a detailed
technical account of a pair of current applications that exemplifi; AI&#39;s
move to the center of the redistributive and coercive power of the
state: the Social Security Administration&#39;s use of AI tools to
adjudicate disability benefits cases and the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#39;s use of AI tools to target enforcement efforts under federal
securities law. We argue that the next generation of work will need to
push past a narrow focus on constitutional law and instead engage with
the broader terrain of administrative law, which is far more likely to
modulate use of algorithmic governance tools going forward. We
demonstrate the shortcomings of conventional ex ante and ex post review
under current administrative law doctrines and then consider how those
doctrines might adapt in response. Finally, we ask how else to build a
sensible accountability structure around public sector use of
algorithmic governance tools while maintaining incentives and
opportunities for salutary innovation. Reviewing some commonly offered
solutions, we propose a further and novel approach to oversight centered
on prospective benchmarking. By requiring agencies to reserve a random
set of cases for manual decision making, benchmarking offers a concrete
and accessible test of the validity and legality of machine outputs,
enabling agencies, courts, and the public to learn about, validate, and
correct errors in algorithmic decision making.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how governments work, from
distribution of public benefits, to identifying enforcement targets, to
meting out sanctions. But given AI&#39;s twin capacity to cause and cure
error, bias, and inequity, there is little consensus about how to
regulate its use. This review advances debate by lifting up research at
the intersection of computer science, organizational behavior, and law.
First, pushing past the usual catalogs of algorithmic harms and
benefits, we argue that what makes government AI most concerning is its
steady advance into discretion-laden policy spaces where we have long
tolerated less-than-full legal accountability. The challenge is how, but
also whether, to fortify existing public law paradigms without
hamstringing government or stymieing useful innovation. Second, we argue
that sound regulation must connect emerging knowledge about internal
agency practices in designing and implementing AI systems to
longer-standing lessons about the limits of external legal constraints
in inducing organizations to adopt desired practices. Meaningful
accountability requires a more robust understanding of organizational
behavior and law as AI permeates bureaucratic routines.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article focuses on the legal implications of the growing reliance
on automated systems in public administrations, using the example of
social security benefits administration. It specifically addresses the
deployment of automated systems for decisions on benefits eligibility
within the frameworks of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). It compares how these two
legal frameworks, each targeting different regulatory objects (personal
data versus AI systems) and employing different protective measures,
apply for two common system types: rule-based systems utilised for
making fully automated decisions on eligibility, and machine learning AI
systems utilised for assisting case administrators in their
decision-making. It concludes on the combined impact that the GDPR and
the AIA will have on each of these types of systems, as well as on
differences in how these instruments determines the basic legality of
utilising such systems within social security administration.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
(HITECH) successfully encouraged widespread adoption of electronic
health records (EHR). Their suitability for &#x60;&#x60;big data&#39;&#39; analysis make
EHR data immensely valuable for secondary research, which could help
scientists develop new drugs, medical devices, and public-health
knowledge. Thus far, EHR data have not been widely available to academic
medical scientists in quantities sufficient to support big data
analysis. Instead, the data are aggregated, analyzed, and sold by
insurance companies, EHR vendors, and other medical informatics firms.
This Note argues that the advent of the EHR data market is a direct
result of HITECH&#39;s interaction with the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (together, the &#x60;&#x60;Privacy Regime&#39;&#39;).
The Privacy Regime (1) establishes the necessary preconditions for the
EHR data market; (2) funnels EHR data towards a few large firms; and (3)
prevents others, including academic scientists, from acquiring data in
similarly large quantities.
The Privacy Regime has radically changed medical research regulation.
Traditional clinical trials and retrospective studies are governed by
the familiar safeguards of medical ethics including IRB review, peer
review, and publication. But under the Privacy Regime, private-sector
EHR-based studies are not subject to any ethical review. This result
subverts the fundamental principles of medical ethics and inhibits
socially valuable public-sector research. This Note proposes reforming
the Privacy Regime to subject all medical research to ethical review and
to incentivize private firms to share EHR data with academic
researchers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Many countries have started to reopen economic activities after the COVID-19 pandemic; however, due to the disease’s long incubation period and high infectivity, social distancing remains an essential measure despite the start of vaccinations. It is therefore necessary to understand the changes in human mobility from the outbreak’s initiation to deceleration to control the disease’s transmission and revitalize the economy. This study suggests a methodology for investigating the changes in human mobility and their influencing factors using a case study of Seoul Metropolitan City, Korea. First, the changing patterns of human mobility were investigated based on mobile big data, including the acceleration and deceleration stages. The results showed that it varied by area and travel distance. Second, we clarified the influence of sociodemographic factors such as employee density and land use proportion on the change pattern of human mobility by applying a machine learning method. This finding implies that the effectiveness of policies such as social distancing can vary with sociodemographic factors. For example, areas with more real estate, public administration, and health care employees showed rapid recovery and faced a transmission risk by reopening economic activities. The suggested methodology can help understand human mobility and explore exit strategies. © 2021 by American Association of Geographers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Under the banner of “data for good,” companies in the technology, finance, and retail sectors supply their proprietary datasets to development agencies, NGOs, and intergovernmental organizations to help solve an array of social problems. We focus on the activities and implications of the Data for Climate Action campaign, a set of public–private collaborations that wield user data to design innovative responses to the global climate crisis. Drawing on in-depth interviews, first-hand observations at “data for good” events, intergovernmental and international organizational reports, and media publicity, we evaluate the logic driving Data for Climate Action initiatives, examining the implications of applying commercial datasets and expertise to environmental problems. Despite the increasing adoption of Data for Climate Action paradigms in government and public sector efforts to address climate change, we argue Data for Climate Action is better seen as a strategy to legitimate extractive, profit-oriented data practices by companies than a means to achieve global goals for environmental sustainability. © The Author(s) 2021.</abstract>

      <abstract>A national data infrastructure (NDI) provides data, data-related services and guidelines for the re-use of data to individuals and organizations. It facilitates efficient sharing of data, supports new business models, and is thus a key enabler for the digital economy, open research, societal collaboration and political processes. While several European countries have taken steps to set up data infrastructures cutting across institutional silos, approaches vary, and there is no common understanding of what a NDI exactly comprises. In Switzerland, activities are still at a conceptual stage. In order to foster a shared vision of what a NDI is about, stakeholder interviews were carried out with representatives of public administration, research, civil society, and the private sector. There is broad consensus among key stakeholders that a NDI is to be conceived as a nationwide distributed technical infrastructure allowing the sharing of data, based on predefined rules. Our findings also suggest that the notion of a NDI should be approached from four perspectives: A big data, a base register, an open data, and a mydata perspective. For its implementation, effective coordination across several dimensions (ethical, legal, political, economical, organizational, semantical, and technical) is crucial, which calls for a truly multidisciplinary approach. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

      <abstract>Today&#39;s world is moving towards Big Data since there is an urgent requirement to collect and preserve any type of data which is being generated, so that no essential data is missed out in any form. There is a huge amount of data floating around in all private and public sectors. Especially for a Government to understand the citizen needs and to provide a good governance, analysis and management of data obtained from e-governance applications is important. This paper focus on evaluating the performance of common NoSQL databases in a Hadoop file system when it is used for BigData analytics and recommend an optimal NoSQL database that suits a E-Governance application. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

      <abstract>The barriers to implementing circular supply chains are well explored,
but very little is provided to understand how these barriers play in
public sector supply chains. Consequently, the role of digital
technologies in addressing these barriers in the circularity of supply
chains in the public sector remains a gap. Thus, this study bridges
these gaps by evaluating digital technologies according to their
relevance in addressing the identified barriers. In particular, eight
domain experts who have sufficient knowledge and expertise in the
domains of the public sector and circular economy were asked to elicit
judgments in order to (1) set a threshold that defines the list of
barriers that are significant to supply chains in the public sector, (2)
obtain the priority weights of these barriers through the criteria
importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), and (3) rank the
identified digital technologies based on their relevance in addressing
the identified barriers in public sector supply chains using combinative
distance-based assessment (CODAS) method, all under a Fermatean fuzzy
set environment to account for epistemic uncertainties in judgment
elicitation processes. This novel integration of the CRITIC and CODAS
methods augmented by Fermatean fuzzy sets forms the methodological
contribution of this work. Findings show that barriers associated with
regulations restricting the collection of wastes, poor demand or
acceptance for environmentally superior technologies, lack of expertise,
technology, and information, operational risk, immature recycling
technologies, and information sharing and communication were considered
critical in managing circular public sector supply chains. The analysis
also revealed that ripple effect modeling, simulation, and artificial
intelligence are the priority digital technologies. These digital
technologies offer efficiency and flexibility to decision-makers in
analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios before the deployment of any
circularity initiative, providing crucial information in its design and
implementation. This paper outlines several managerial insights and
offers possible agenda for future research.</abstract>

      <abstract>For years, scholarly interest in the intersection of government and
technology has overwhelmingly focused on the end-product of technology
capabilities. Recent advancements in computational power have
facilitated breathtaking growth of data analytics, artificial
intelligence (AI), and process automation, sparking considerable
attention by scholars and practitioners alike. However, insight
concerning the technology hardware assets powering emergent applications
in the public sector remains glaringly absent amidst this rapidly
expanding area of research. We position that gaining a greater
understanding of the scope of technology utility in governance requires
exploration of not only the applications or interfaces produced by
technology hardware, but rather the aim of promoting both modernity and
processing capacity of the hardware driving technology in government.</abstract>

      <abstract>In France, general legislative rules of proof of facts between the administrations and the citizens are rare. Nevertheless, there are real obligations for public administrations to base their decisions on factual evidence, and for citizens to provide evidence they hold. The inquisitorial litigation procedure is the main asset of French administrative law because it relieves citizens who take a case to the administrative courts and who do not have all the evidence, some of which is often held by the administrations. Freedom of assessment of evidence is also an important principle which facilitates the administration of evidence for the parties and the judges. However, the disinterest of the legislator with regard to proof in the relations between administrations and citizens can no longer persist in the face of the probative issues raised by digitization and especially big data and artificial intelligence.

      <abstract>The article deals with the problem of modeling the effectiveness of the development of financial decentralization mechanisms. A conceptual approach is proposed, which allows to form a complex of models. The models allow to evaluate the socio-economic effects of financial decentralization increase; to determine the “threshold” value of the level of financial decentralization, upon which slowdown in economic growth may occur. The models are based on based on the principal components’ method, canonical correlations, cluster analysis, Kohonen neural networks, the level of development method, production and institutional functions. The modeling results showed that a high level of financial decentralization is inherent to countries with a high level of economic development, where high quality institutional environment and administrative decentralization lead to the increase of the efficiency of the public sector functioning. At the same time, in countries with a high level of competitiveness and socio-economic development the gap between the growth rates of income and expenditure powers of budgets of various levels and the growth rate of GDP is growing. This fact reduces the level of budget and debt security. Models of production and institutional functions have been developed, countries with a “reference” development model have been identified, as well as groups of countries that would have a higher effect from the re-centralization of government finances or financial decentralization. © 2019 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.</abstract>

      <abstract>Considering that the Public Administration may not be able to internally develop the technologies necessary for its digital transformation process, having to procure them on the private market, the exclusivity of copyright could affirm an unprecedented dominance of private operators over the entire public decision-making process. On the other hand, claiming the right to reveal the source code of the algorithm constitutes a guarantee of transparency, freedom of information and civic engagement, in line with Open Government policies. Leaving aside the legal debate about the qualification of the source code as an administrative act, which recently took place in Italy, this work aims to investigate the morphology of intellectual property in the era of algorithmic Administration in order to understand whether intellectual property rights should, or not, to succumb whenever it is necessary to choose, acquire and use information technology to carry out administrative activities. © 2023, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

      <abstract>Nations have recognized the transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in AI will impact all facets of society. A spate of recently released national strategic AI plans provides valuable insights into how nations are considering their future trajectories. These strategic plans offer a rich source of evidence to understand national-level strategic actions, both proactive and reactive, in the face of rapid technological innovation. Based on a comprehensive content analysis of thirty-four national strategic plans, this article reports on (1) opportunities for AI to modernize the public sector and enhance industry competitiveness, (2) the role of the public sector in ensuring that the two most critical elements of AI systems, data and algorithms, are managed responsibly, (3) the role of the public sector in the governance of AI systems, and (4) how nations plan to invest in capacity development initiatives to strengthen their AI capabilities. © 2020 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland</abstract>

      <abstract>PurposeThis study investigates the relationships between data governance
(DG), business analytics capabilities (BAC), and decision-making
performance (DMP), with a focus on the mediating effects of big data
literacy (BDL) and data analytics competency
(DAC).Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approachThe study was conducted with 178
experienced managers in public service organizations, using a
quantitative approach. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation
tests were employed to analyze the data.FindingsThe findings reveal that
DG and BDL are critical antecedents for developing analytical
capabilities. Big data literacy mediates the relationship between DG and
BAC, while BAC mediates the relationship between DG and DMP.
Furthermore, DAC mediates the relationship between BA capabilities and
DMP, explaining most of the effect of BAC on DMP.Practical
implicationsThese results highlight the importance of DG in fostering
BDL and analytical skills for improved decision-making in
organizations.Originality&#x2F;valueBy prioritizing DG practices that promote
BDL and analytical capabilities, organizations can leverage business
analytics to enhance decision-making.</abstract>

      <abstract>This research study investigates the mediating influence of co-collaboration (Co-Collab) on the relationship between big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) and decision-making performance (DMP). Using a quantitative approach, 189 managers with experience and competence in using data in Indonesian public service sector organizations were empirically evaluated. Structural Equation Modeling analysis was applied to examine the impact of BDAC on DMP and mediating effects of Co-Collab on this relationship. The results demonstrate that BDAC and Co-Collab significantly influence DMP, and BDAC significantly affects Co-Collab. Notably, Co-Collab was identified as a complementary mediator in the relationship between BDAC and DMP, explaining the majority of their effects. These findings suggest the significance for organizational leaders and managers to develop plans that nurture BDAC and implement Co-Collab processes to maximize the business&#39;s utilization of big data. Therefore, deriving value from big data to improve organizational DMP requires collaboration between data science experts and business users. Thus, organizations can establish policies and strategies to extract value from data and leverage business community and DMP through BDAC. This approach not only transcends the conventional views of big data analytics as a resource for attaining competitive advantage but also acknowledges its role as a business community that can drive performance within organizations, thereby enriching the existing social capital theory literature. Moreover, the study highlights opportunities for future studies, including comparative analysis across different organizations, experimental research on Co-Collab and DMP, and the application of concurrent or sequential mixed methods to explore context and process relationships among variables. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

      <abstract>Given the unprecedented scale of intergovernmental development funding and the importance of institutional quality for human well-being, it is imperative to precisely understand the impact of development funds on corruption. In Europe, European Union (EU) Funds provide a boost to public spending in recipient member states while introducing additional corruption controls. We investigate whether EU Funds increase high-level corruption in the Czech Republic and Hungary in 2009–2012. We analyze newly collected data from over 100,000 public procurement contracts to develop objective corruption risk indicators and link them to agency level data in the public sector. Propensity score matching estimations suggest that EU funds increase corruption risk by up to 34 percent. The negative effects are largely attributable to overly formalistic compliance and EU Funds overriding domestic accountability mechanisms in public organizations entirely dependent on external funds. The policy implications are profound: governments should reduce barriers to market entry by lowering red tape and prevent excessive concentration of funds. © 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia, Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly popular concept, although it is often used only as a marketing tool to label activities that are very far from AI. The purpose of this article is to show what artificial intelligence (AI) tools - expert systems - can actually be used for administrative decision in public administration. The end of the administrative decision must be justified in detail according to the legal regulations. Expert systems do this. The other large group of AI tools, solutions based on machine learning, act as black boxes, mapping input data to output data, so the reason for the solution is unknown. Therefore, these tools are not suitable for direct, administrative decision, but can support office work with expert systems. In this article, we present the operation of expert systems through examples. © 2021 Brepols Publishers. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>Objective: This article, of a theoretical nature, was oriented to the contextual analysis referred to digital government, its origin, aspects, and trends; mainly, the way in which it was implemented and developed in some Latin American countries was emphasized, in addition to the reflections on the implications related to digital government in the current situation, as well as the challenges it has been facing and future challenges. Theoretical framework: The universe of more contemporary aspects regarding electronic government was explored from the perspective of state management, as well as the foundations on which it has been consolidating and the changes it has undergone and at the same time generated in its wide spectrum of applications. Design&#x2F;Methodology&#x2F;Approach: A descriptive systematic review has been implemented with the collection of various definitions, approaches and strategies in relation to electronic government. Based on the qualitative approach, the analysis and extraction of various articles with relevant information from various databases such as Scopus, Ebsco, ProQuest and Scielo was carried out; taking into account those of the last four years. Findings: The acceptance of electronic government processes was based on the characteristics of citizens and their attitude towards technology; public bodies continue to show a series of problems, among which a marked inability to resolve the duties effectively and efficiently in charge despite having the appropriate technological tools and implements stands out. Research, practical and social implications: Future efforts that seek not only electronic government, but also a scaffolding that supports the development of administration processes through TIC and new platforms based on artificial intelligence. Implications&#x2F;Originality&#x2F;Value: The real implementation of an electronic government requires, urges and forces cultural changes in society due to the use of TIC and cutting-edge technological resources. © 2023 AOS-Estratagia and Inovacao.

      <abstract>The radio broadcasting industry is facing a process of profound digital
transformation throughout which, over the last 20 years, the strategies
to preserve the traditional business model have prevailed. The
consolidation of platformization and datafication in the economic
management of the media requires adaptation of the radio broadcasting
sector&#39;s structures, management models, and corporate culture. Through
an exhaustive bibliographic review, nonparticipant observation, and
in-depth interviews conducted with heads of the systems, sales and
marketing, content, and digital and innovation departments of the three
leading Spanish companies (Prisa Radio, Grupo COPE, and Atresmedia
Radio) and the state public broadcaster (RNE), we seek to identify the
functional areas of the radio broadcasting company in which big data
(BD) has a greater potential for application, trying to establish the
differences in its utilization in the analogue and digital business
model. The results revealed that the degree of BD implementation in the
Spanish radio broadcasting industry was significantly different between
the private sector -which within the last 2 or 3 years has begun to
introduce, very incipiently, big data management, applied primarily to
the analysis of digital audiences, these users&#39; consumer behavior, and
business management- and the public sector, which so far has not adopted
these technologies on a systematic basis.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: The Government’s investment in infrastructure projects is considerably high, especially in bridge construction projects. Government authorities must establish an initial forecasted budget to have transparency in transactions. Early cost estimating is challenging for Quantity Surveyors due to incomplete project details at the initial stage and the unavailability of standard cost estimating techniques for bridge projects. To mitigate the difficulties in the traditional preliminary cost estimating methods, there is a requirement to develop a new initial cost estimating model which is accurate, user friendly and straightforward. The research was carried out in Sri Lanka, and this paper aims to develop the artificial neural network (ANN) model for an early cost estimate of concrete bridge systems. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: The construction cost data of 30 concrete bridge projects which are in Sri Lanka constructed within the past ten years were trained and tested to develop an ANN cost model. Backpropagation technique was used to identify the number of hidden layers, iteration and momentum for optimum neural network architectures. Findings: An ANN cost model was developed, furnishing the best result since it succeeded with around 90% validation accuracy. It created a cost estimation model for the public sector as an accurate, heuristic, flexible and efficient technique. Originality&#x2F;value: The research contributes to the current body of knowledge by providing the most accurate early-stage cost estimate for the concrete bridge systems in Sri Lanka. In addition, the research findings would be helpful for stakeholders and policymakers to propose policy recommendations that positively influence the prediction of the most accurate cost estimate for concrete bridge construction projects in Sri Lanka and other developing countries. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>An effective crisis response requires up-to-date information. The crisis cell must reach for new, external, data sources. However, new data lead to new issues: their volume, veracity, variety or velocity cannot be managed by humans only, especially under high stress and time pressure. This paper proposes (i) a framework to enhance situation awareness while managing the 5Vs of Big Data, (ii) general principles to be followed and (iii) a new architecture implementing the proposed framework. The latter merges event-driven and model-driven architectures. It has been tested on a realistic flood scenario set up by official French services. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent years have seen a massive growth in ethical and legal frameworks
to govern data science practices. Yet one of the core questions
associated with ethical and legal frameworks is the extent to which they
are implemented in practice. A particularly interesting case in this
context comes to public officials, for whom higher standards typically
exist. We are thus trying to understand how ethical and legal frameworks
influence the everyday practices on data and algorithms of public sector
data professionals. The following paper looks at two cases: public
sector data professionals (1) at municipalities in the Netherlands and
(2) at the Netherlands Police. We compare these two cases based on an
analytical research framework we develop in this article to help
understanding of everyday professional practices. We conclude that there
is a wide gap between legal and ethical governance rules and the
everyday practices.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to have
a major impact on the ways governments provide services to the
population. The major objective of this paper is to identify success
factors for AI adoption in public sector organizations and understand
the interrelationships among them. Eleven factors were identified from
the literature and were modeled using ISM method. The results show &#x60;&#x60;Top
Management Support&#39;&#39; and &#x60;&#x60;Supportive Regulatory Environment&#39;&#39; as
the most important drivers enabling AI adoption in e-government.
Further, the variable &#x60;&#x60;Training and Skill Development&#39;&#39; is found to
be a critical link in developing &#x60;&#x60;AI-Driven Services Ecosystem&#39;&#39;
leading to business process transformation in e-government. The findings
of this study are expected to provide an insight to further improve and
promote adoption of AI-based solutions in facilitating e-government. The
results of the study are among the first academic attempt to shed light
on the key role of enablers supporting AI adoption in an emerging
economy.</abstract>

      <abstract>As public administrations adopt artificial intelligence (AI), we see
this transition has the potential to transform public service and public
policies, by offering a rapid turnaround on decision making and service
delivery. However, a recent series of criticisms have pointed to
problematic aspects of mainstreaming AI systems in public
administration, noting troubled outcomes in terms of justice and values.
The argument supplied here is that any public administration adopting AI
systems must consider and address ambiguities and uncertainties
surrounding two key dimensions: the algorithms&#39; results, and how public
managers make decisions for and about AI systems&#39; design. The article is
based on bibliographic research in institutional theory perspective that
relates the design of AI systems and relevant literature on the
decision-making process in public policy. The main finding is to explain
why autonomous decision systems continue to reproduce ambiguities and
uncertainties when applied in public administration and propose a
reflection on AI governance in public administration. This article
points to the need for design institutions that immerse themselves in
understanding the nuances, details, and potential outcomes of AI
governance for public administration. Such institutions would reconcile
consequentialist logic with a logic of appropriateness to help navigate
and mediate ambiguities and uncertainties.</abstract>

      <abstract>Mechanisms to control public power have been developed and shaped around
human beings as decision-makers at the centre of the public
administration. However, technology is radically changing how public
administration is organised and reliance on Artificial Intelligence is
on the rise across all sectors. While carrying the promise of an
increasingly efficient administration, automating (parts of)
administrative decision-making processes also poses a challenge to our
human-centred systems of control of public power. This article focuses
on one of these control mechanisms: the duty to give reasons under EU
law, a pillar of administrative law designed to enable individuals to
challenge decisions and courts to exercise their powers of review.
First, it analyses whether the duty to give reasons can be meaningfully
applied when EU bodies rely on AI systems to inform their
decision-making. Secondly, it examines the added value of secondary law,
in particular the data protection rules applicable to EU institutions
and the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act, in complementing and
adapting the duty to give reasons to better fulfil its purpose in a
(partially) automated administration. This article concludes that the
duty to give reasons provides a useful starting point but leaves a
number of aspects unclear. While providing important safeguards, neither
EU data protection law nor the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act
currently fill these gaps.</abstract>

      <abstract>Smart urban transportation management can be considered as a multifaceted big data challenge. It strongly relies on the information collected into multiple, widespread, and heterogeneous data sources as well as on the ability to extract actionable insights from them. Besides data, full stack (from platform to services and applications) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions need to be specifically adopted to address smart cities challenges. Smart urban transportation management is one of the key use cases addressed in the context of the EUBra-BIGSEA (Europe-Brazil Collaboration of Big Data Scientific Research through Cloud-Centric Applications) project. This paper specifically focuses on the City Administration Dashboard, a public transport analytics application that has been developed on top of the EUBra-BIGSEA platform and used by the Municipality stakeholders of Curitiba, Brazil, to tackle urban traffic data analysis and planning challenges. The solution proposed in this paper joins together a scalable big and fast data analytics platform, a flexible and dynamic cloud infrastructure, data quality and entity matching algorithms as well as security and privacy techniques. By exploiting an interoperable programming framework based on Python Application Programming Interface (API), it allows an easy, rapid and transparent development of smart cities applications.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>The European Union presented a draft regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the Data Governance Act, which is the first of the planned tools in the implementation of the European Data Protection Strategy. From the point of view of artificial intelligence, it is the most important EU regulation next to data opening and Directive 2019&#x2F;1024. This solution aims to increase the potential of the data used, among other things, by increasing trust in sharing one’s own resources in the public interest. Despite the lack of definitions and details, these measures should positively impact, among other things, the efficiency of data analytics and machine learning, including in a cross-border context. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a driving force in modern
research, industry and public administration and the European Union (EU)
is embracing this technology with a view to creating societal, as well
as economic, value. This effort has been shared by EU Member States
which were all encouraged to develop their own national AI strategies
outlining policies and investment levels. This study focuses on how EU
Member States are approaching the promise to develop and use AI for the
good of society through the lens of their national AI strategies. In
particular, we aim to investigate how European countries are investing
in AI and to what extent the stated plans contribute to the good of
people and society as a whole. Our contribution consists of three parts:
(i) a conceptualization of AI for social good highlighting the role of
AI policy, in particular, the one put forward by the European Commission
(EC); (ii) a qualitative analysis of 15 European national strategies
mapping investment plans and suggesting their relation to the social
good (iii) a reflection on the current status of investments in socially
good AI and possible steps to move forward. Our study suggests that
while European national strategies incorporate money allocations in the
sphere of AI for social good (e.g. education), there is a broader
variety of underestimated actions (e.g. multidisciplinary approach in
STEM curricula and dialogue among stakeholders) that can boost the
European commitment to sustainable and responsible AI innovation.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study focuses on the role of bioethics in designing public healthcare policies towards elderly patients with cancer. The general overview of public administration and healthcare approach to treatment. Interpretation of how the EU public administration faces the challenges of an ageing population and extended human longevity. The significant emotional impact a genetic cancer test holds, both in the patients and their families, is to be explained. From the bioethics&#39; perspective, artificial intelligence and transhumanism are dangerous concerning its absence of boundaries. As a result of daily contact with cancer, we acknowledge the immediate and relevant impact science produces in a patient&#39;s life. We converge these subjects to the improvement of public policies and governmental efforts in increasing society&#39;s positive results. © 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>Decision-making in organisations faces a change due to the increasing amount of data offering new possibilities in information management and decision-making, or what is called ‘big data’. Despite the interest in big data, little is yet known about the outcome of the practical use of big data in organisations and a wider discussion of its implications is encouraged. This article contributes with examples of how big data is used in practice in the public sector, visualised with a case from the local government context, and how practitioners view big data and the changes in information and knowledge management following with it. Big data is discussed in the theoretical light of organisational knowledge creation and decision-making in organisations. The findings suggest that creating new information and knowledge out of big data, and its use as support for decision-making in organisations, would enhance the quality and increase trustworthiness in decision-making. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>The increasing use of machine learning (ML) in public administration
requires that we think carefully about the political and legal
constraints imposed on public decision making. These developments
confront us with the following interrelated questions: can algorithmic
public decisions be truly &#x60;public&#39;? And, to what extent does the use of
ML models compromise the &#x60;publicness&#39; of such decisions? This article is
part of a broader inquiry into the myriad ways in which digital and AI
technologies transform the fabric of our democratic existence by
mutating the &#x60;public&#39;. Focusing on the site of public administration,
the article develops a conception of publicness that is grounded in a
view of public administrations as communities of practice. These
communities operate through dialogical, critical and synergetic
interactions that allow them to track-as faithfully as possible-the
public&#39;s heterogeneous view of its interests, and reify these interests
in decision making. Building on this theorisation, the article suggests
that the use of ML models in public decision making inevitably generates
an impoverished publicness, and thus undermines the potential of public
administrations to operate as a locus of democratic construction. The
article thus advocates for a reconsideration of the ways in which
administrative law problematises and addresses the harms of algorithmic
decision making.</abstract>

      <abstract>COVID-19 infection rates remain high in South Africa. Clinical prediction models may be helpful for rapid triage, and supporting clinical decision making, for patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. The Western Cape, South Africa, has integrated electronic health care data facilitating large-scale linked routine datasets. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning model to predict adverse outcome in patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 suitable for use in a middle-income setting. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using linked, routine data, from patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection to public-sector emergency departments (EDs) in the Western Cape, South Africa between 27th August 2020 and 31st October 2021. The primary outcome was death or critical care admission at 30 days. An XGBoost machine learning model was trained and internally tested using split-sample validation. External validation was performed in 3 test cohorts: Western Cape patients presenting during the Omicron COVID-19 wave, a UK cohort during the ancestral COVID-19 wave, and a Sudanese cohort during ancestral and Eta waves. A total of 282,051 cases were included in a complete case training dataset. The prevalence of 30-day adverse outcome was 4.0%. The most important features for predicting adverse outcome were the requirement for supplemental oxygen, peripheral oxygen saturations, level of consciousness and age. Internal validation using split-sample test data revealed excellent discrimination (C-statistic 0.91, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.91) and calibration (CITL of 1.05). The model achieved C-statistics of 0.84 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.85), 0.72 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.73), and 0.62, (95% CI 0.59 to 0.65) in the Omicron, UK, and Sudanese test cohorts. Results were materially unchanged in sensitivity analyses examining missing data. An XGBoost machine learning model achieved good discrimination and calibration in prediction of adverse outcome in patients presenting with suspected COVID19 to Western Cape EDs. Performance was reduced in temporal and geographical external validation. © 2023 Fuller et al.

      <abstract>The application of tools and methods based on artificial intelligence in
the public sector management process has become a priority issue.
Considering this, the objective of this paper was to analyze its use in
the field of government and services in Azerbaijan. In the study, the
sample study method, the comparative statistical analysis method, the
evaluation method and the questionnaire-survey methods were used. A
questionnaire with a total of 26 questions was administered to 200
respondents to measure the attitude towards the use of electronic
services and digital government applications in the field of
administration in Azerbaijan, and the results were analyzed with the
SPSS 16.0 program. It was found that despite significant advances in the
country in this field, there are still areas of opportunity to work, and
it is necessary to educate the population more. The practical importance
of the use of modern information and communication technologies in state
agencies is justified by their proven benefits; however, their
limitations and potential difficulties in their implementation cannot be
underestimated.</abstract>

      <abstract>Is it possible to predict malfeasance in public procurement? With the
proliferation of e-procurement systems in the public sector,
anti-corruption agencies and watchdog organizations have access to
valuable sources of information with which to identify transactions that
are likely to become troublesome and why. In this article, we discuss
the promises and challenges of using machine learning models to predict
inefficiency and corruption in public procurement. We illustrate this
approach with a dataset with more than two million public procurement
contracts in Colombia. We trained machine learning models to predict
which of them will result in corruption investigations, a breach of
contract, or implementation inefficiencies. We then discuss how our
models can help practitioners better understand the drivers of
corruption and inefficiency in public procurement. Our approach will be
useful to governments interested in exploiting large administrative
datasets to improve the provision of public goods, and it highlights
some of the tradeoffs and challenges that they might face throughout
this process. (C) 2020 International Institute of Forecasters. Published

      <abstract>Ground-level ozone (O3), renowned for its adverse impacts on human health and crop production, has garnered significant attention from governmental and public sectors. To address the limitations posed by sparse and uneven ground-level O3 observations, this study proposes an innovative method for hourly full-coverage ground-level O3 estimation using machine learning. Meteorological data from National Centers for Environmental Prediction global forecasting system, satellite data from Fengyun-4 A(FY-4 A) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument, emission inventory from Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China, and other auxiliary data are utilized as input variables, while ground-based O3 observations serve as the response variable. The method is applied on a monthly basis across China for the year 2022, resulting in the generation of an hourly full-coverage high-resolution (4 km) ground-level O3 estimation, termed ML-derived-O3. Cross-validation results demonstrate the robustness of ML-derived-O3 yielding a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.96 (0.91) for sample-based (site-based) evaluations and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 9.22 (13.65) µg m−3. However, the date-based evaluation is less satisfactory due to the imbalanced training data, resulting from the pronounced daily variations in ground-level O3 concentrations. Nevertheless, the seasonal and hourly ML-derived-O3 exhibits high prediction accuracy, with R 2 values surpassing 0.95 and RMSE remaining below 7.5 µg m−3. This study marks a significant milestone as the first successful attempt to obtain hourly full-coverage ground-level O3 data across China. The diurnal variation of ML-derived-O3 demonstrates high consistency with ground-based observations, irrespective of clear or cloudy days, effectively capturing ground-level O3 pollution exposure events. This novel estimation method will be employed to establish a long-term high spatial-temporal resolution ground-level O3 dataset, which holds valuable applications for air pollution monitoring and environmental health research in future endeavors. © 2024 The Author(s).

      <abstract>In the construction of knowledge bases, it is very important to evaluate the quality of the knowledge entered into them. This is exacerbated in public administrations, where knowledge should be oriented towards public services. In this study, an artificial intelligence-based method for the evaluation of knowledge is described. This method takes advantage of the structure and contents of the knowledge representation schemas (representing the knowledge of the corresponding experts) to carry out knowledge evaluation. More precisely, the method allows the various comparisons between the schemas to be integrated and the overall schema to evaluate the contribution of each schema. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The World Wide Web is evolving rapidly, and the Internet is now accessible to millions of users, providing them with the means to access a wealth of information, entertainment and e-commerce opportunities. Web browsing is largely impersonal and anonymous, and because of the large population that uses it, it is difficult to separate and categorize users according to their preferences. One solution to this problem is to create a web-platform that acts as a middleware between end users and the web, in order to analyze the data that is available to them. The method by which user information is collected and sorted according to preference is called ‘user profiling‘. These profiles could be enriched using neural networks. In this article, we present our implementation of an online profiling mechanism in a virtual e-shop and how neural networks could be used to predict the characteristics of new users. The major contribution of this article is to outline the way our online profiles could be beneficial both to customers and stores. When shopping at a traditional physical store, real time targeted “personalized” advertisements can be delivered directly to the mobile devices of consumers while they are walking around the stores next to specific products, which match their buying habits. © 2022 by the authors.

      <abstract>Building the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is conducive to
promoting the high economic integration of Guangdong, Hong Kong and
Macao, building a new open economic system, and carrying out dual
exploration of politics and economy, which is of great strategic
significance. Public governance is not only a substitute for the
traditional public administration paradigm, but also a product of
interdisciplinary research and multidisciplinary development of social
science. Its greatest feature is that it is a transcendence of
traditional government domination theory. Close integration of economic
decentralization and vertical political management system is the core
connotation of Chinese-style decentralization. In terms of fiscal
system, China is among the countries with the highest degree of
decentralization in the world. Starting from the concept of public goods
and based on data mining algorithm, this paper expounds the basic theory
of public goods supply mode and the factors affecting the supply of
public goods. On the basis of clear theory, this paper probes into the
characteristics and existing problems of the traditional supply mode of
public goods in China, which has positive significance for improving the
quantity and quality of the supply of public goods in Guangdong-Hong
Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.</abstract>

      <abstract>The rapid spread of COVID-19 disease has had a significant impact on the world. In this paper, we study COVID-19 data interpretation and visualization using open-data sources for 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts from December 6, 2020 to September 25, 2021. Because cities are embedded in rather complex transportation networks, we construct the spatio-temporal dynamic graph model, in which the graph attention neural network is utilized as a deep learning method to learn the pandemic transition probability among major cities in Massachusetts. Using the spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT), we process the COVID-19 data on the dynamic graph, which enables us to design effective tools to analyze and detect spatio-temporal patterns in the pandemic spreading. We design a new node classification method, which effectively identifies the anomaly cities based on spectral graph wavelet coefficients. It can assist administrations or public health organizations in monitoring the spread of the pandemic and developing preventive measures. Unlike most work focusing on the evolution of confirmed cases over time, we focus on the spatio-temporal patterns of pandemic evolution among cities. Through the data analysis and visualization, a better understanding of the epidemiological development at the city level is obtained and can be helpful with city-specific surveillance.  © 2015 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big data sets in conjunction with self-learning algorithms are becoming
increasingly important in public administration. A growing body of
literature demonstrates that the use of such technologies poses
fundamental questions about the way in which predictions are generated,
and the extent to which such predictions may be used in policy making.
Complementing other recent works, the goal of this article is to open
the machine&#39;s black box to understand and critically examine how
self-learning algorithms gain agency by transforming raw data into
policy recommendations that are then used by policy makers. I identify
five major concerns and discuss the implications for policy making.</abstract>

      <abstract>Interest in implementing artificial intelligence (AI)-based software in
the public sector is growing. First implementations and research in
individual public services have already been carried out; however, a
better understanding of citizens&#39; acceptance of this technology is
missing in the public sector, as insights from the private sector cannot
be transferred directly. For this purpose, we conduct policy-capturing
experiments to analyze AI&#39;s acceptance in six representative scenarios.
Based on behavioral reasoning theory, we gather evidence from 329
participants. The results show that AI solutions in general public
services are preferred over those provided by humans, but specific
services are still a human domain. Further analyses show that the major
drivers toward acceptance are the reasons against AI. The results
contribute to understanding of when and why AI is accepted in public
services. Public administration can use the results to identify AI-based
software to invest in and communicate their usage to perceive such
investments&#39; high acceptance rates.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose Being an efficient mechanism for the value of money,
public-private partnership (PPP) is one of the most prominent approaches
for infrastructure construction. Hence, many controversies about the
performance effectiveness of these delivery systems have been debated.
This research aims to develop a novel performance management perspective
by revealing the causal effect of key performance indicators (KPIs) on
PPP infrastructures. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach The literature review
was used in this study to extract the PPPs KPIs. Experts&#39; judgment and
interviews, as well as questionnaires, were designed to obtain data.
Copula Bayesian network (CBN) has been selected to achieve the research
purpose. CBN is one of the most potent tools in statistics for analyzing
the causal relationship of different elements and considering their
quantitive impact on each other. By utilizing this technique and using
Python as one of the best programming languages, this research used
machine learning methods, SHAP and XGBoost, to optimize the network.
Findings The sensitivity analysis of the KPIs verified the causation
importance in PPPs performance management. This study determined the
causal structure of KPIs in PPP projects, assessed each indicator&#39;s
priority to performance, and found 7 of them as a critical cluster to
optimize the network. These KPIs include innovation for financing,
feasibility study, macro-environment impact, appropriate financing
option, risk identification, allocation, sharing, and transfer, finance
infrastructure, and compliance with the legal and regulatory framework.
Practical implications Identifying the most scenic indicators helps the
private sector to allocate the limited resources more rationally and
concentrate on the most influential parts of the project. It also
provides the KPIs&#39; critical cluster that should be controlled and
monitored closely by PPP project managers. Additionally, the public
sector can evaluate the performance of the private sector more
accurately. Finally, this research provides a comprehensive causal
insight into the PPPs&#39; performance management that can be used to
develop management systems in future research. Originality&#x2F;value For the
first time, this research proposes a model to determine the causal
structure of KPIs in PPPs and indicate the importance of this insight.
The developed innovative model identifies the KPIs&#39; behavior and takes a
non-linear approach based on CBN and machine learning methods while
providing valuable information for construction and performance managers
to allocate resources more efficiently.</abstract>

      <abstract>E-learning systems are receiving ever increasing attention in academia, business and public administration. Major crises, like the pandemic, highlight the tremendous importance of the appropriate development of e-learning systems and its adoption and processes in organizations. Managers and employees who need efficient forms of training and learning flow within organizations do not have to gather in one place at the same time or to travel far away to attend courses. Contemporary affordances of e-learning systems allow users to perform different jobs or tasks for training courses according to their own scheduling, as well as to collaborate and share knowledge and experiences that result in rich learning flows within organizations. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic review of empirical studies at the intersection of e-learning and organizational learning in order to summarize the current findings and guide future research. Forty-seven peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. This survey identifies five major directions of the research on the confluence of e-learning and organizational learning during the last decade. Future research should leverage big data produced from the platforms and investigate how the incorporation of advanced learning technologies (e.g., learning analytics, personalized learning) can help increase organizational value. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>In line with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.2, South Africa’s National Development Plan commits to providing high-quality early childhood education to all children by 2030 to drive improved child outcomes. Prior to 2016, South Africa lacked reliable, locally standardised, valid, and cross-culturally fair assessment tools for measuring preschool quality and child outcomes, suitable for use at scale within a resource-constrained context. In this paper we detail the development and evolution of a suite of early learning measurement (ELOM) tools designed to address this measurement gap. The development process included reviews of literature and other relevant assessment tools; a review of local curriculum standards and expected child outcomes; extensive consultation with government officials, child development experts, and early learning practitioners, iterative user testing; and assessment of linguistic, cultural, functional, and metric equivalence across all 11 official South African languages. To support use of the ELOM tools at scale, and by users with varying levels of research expertise, administration is digitised and embedded within an end-to-end data value chain. ELOM data collected since 2016 quantify the striking socio-economic gradient in early childhood development in South Africa, demonstrate the relationship between physical stunting, socio-emotional functioning and learning outcomes, and provide evidence of the positive impact of high-quality early learning programmes on preschool child outcomes. To promote secondary analyses, data from multiple studies are regularly collated into a shared dataset, which is made open access via an online data portal. We describe the services and support that make up the ELOM data value chain, noting several key challenges and enablers of data-driven change within this context. These include deep technical expertise within a multidisciplinary and collaborative team, patient and flexible capital from mission-aligned investors, a fit-for-purpose institutional home, the appropriate use of technology, a user-centred approach to development and testing, sensitivity to children’s diverse linguistic and socio-economic circumstances, careful consideration of requirements for scale, appropriate training and support for a non-professional assessor base, and a commitment to ongoing learning and continuous enhancement. Practical examples are provided of ways in which the ELOM tools and data are used for programme monitoring and enhancement purposes, to evaluate the relative effectiveness of early learning interventions, to motivate for greater budget and inform more effective resource allocation, to support the development of enabling Government systems, and to track progress towards the attainment of national and global development goals. We share lessons learnt during the development of the tools and discuss the factors that have driven their uptake in South Africa. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The paper highlights the effects of AI implementation on public sector
innovation. This is explored by asking how AI-driven technologies in
public decision-making in different organizational contexts impacts
innovation in the role definition of bureaucrats. We focus on
organizational as well as agency- and individual-level factors in two
cases: The Dutch Childcare Allowance case and the US Integrated Data
Automated System. We observe administrative process innovation in both
cases where organizational structures and tasks of bureaucrats are
transformed, and in the US case we also find conceptual innovation in
that welfare fraud is addressed by replacing bureaucrats all together.</abstract>

      <abstract>The buzz surrounding big data has taken shape in various theoretical and practical forms when it comes to policymaking. The paper combines current research streams with long-standing discussions on government and technology in public policy and public administration, such as e-government and evidence-based policymaking. The goal is to answer the question whether big data is a fleeting trend or has long-lasting effects on policymaking. Three larger themes in the literature are identified: First, the role that institutional capacity has within government to utilize big data analytics; second, government use of big data analytics in the context of digital public services; and finally, the way that big data information enters the policy cycle, focusing on substantive and procedural policy instruments. Examples from the education, crisis management, environmental and healthcare domain highlight the opportunities and challenges for each of these themes. Exploring the various aspects of big data and policymaking shows that big data is here to stay, but that its utilization by government will take time due to institutional barriers and capacity bottlenecks. © 2017, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>The growth in e-commerce that our society has faced in recent years is changing the view companies have on last-mile logistics, due to its increasing impact on the whole supply chain. New technologies are raising users’ expectations with the need to develop customized delivery experiences; moreover, increasing pressure on supply chains has also created additional challenges for suppliers. At the same time, this phenomenon generates an increase in the impact on the liveability of our cities, due to traffic congestion, the occupation of public spaces, and the environmental and acoustic pollution linked to urban logistics. In this context, the optimization of last-mile deliveries is an imperative not only for companies with parcels that need to be delivered in the urban areas, but also for public administrations that want to guarantee a good quality of life for citizens. In recent years, many scholars have focused on the study of logistics optimization techniques and, in particular, the last mile. In addition to traditional optimization techniques, linked to the disciplines of operations research, the recent advances in the use of sensors and IoT, and the consequent large amount of data that derives from it, are pushing towards a greater use of big data and analytics techniques—such as machine learning and artificial intelligence—which are also in this sector. Based on this premise, the aim of this work is to provide an overview of the most recent literature advances related to last-mile delivery optimization techniques; this is to be used as a baseline for scholars who intend to explore new approaches and techniques in the study of last-mile logistics optimization. A bibliometric analysis and a critical review were conducted in order to highlight the main studied problems, the algorithms used, and the case studies. The results from the analysis allow the studies to be clustered into traditional optimization models, machine learning approaches, and mixed methods. The main research gaps and limitations of the current literature are assessed in order to identify unaddressed challenges and provide research suggestions for future ap-proaches. © 2022 by the authors.

      <abstract>This Practice and Policy paper presents reflections on the opportunities
and challenges of using a novel big data set, Microsoft 365 digital
activity records, in a mixed method study of flexible working. Our
experience identified methodological and ethical considerations for
practitioners and researchers in public sector workforce analytics. The
benefits include data captured in situ and over time for all employees.
The limitations reflect the inadequacy of big data for representing the
complexity of organisational behaviour and the need to accompany data
collection with systems ensuring employee privacy and consent for the
use of data not originally recorded for research or evaluation purposes.
It contributes to knowledge through providing insights into what public
sector big data sets contain and how such data can be accessed,
interpreted, and used in workforce decision-making. Points for
practitionersDigital activity records are a useful form of big data for
public sector workforce analytics.Digital activity records can support
the identification of potential risks within the workforce such as
social isolation and excessive work hours.Big data must be
contextualised with qualitative or other additional data to interpret
data patterns and generate meaningful implementation insights.Privacy
and consent processes may require revision to fully utilise workforce
big data.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article considers the main changes taking place in the economy due to the development of information technologies. Industry 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution, the digitalization of the economy, and digital management are exactly the new realities in management that are rapidly changing the social production and the life of society in general. Many researchers speak of an unprecedented rate of change. But in order to be able to take advantage of progress, one needs a flexible environment ready for constant updates. At that, the main components of such an environment should be innovative technological infrastructure and psychological readiness of contemporary society, business, and the state to master advanced technologies and use them in their activities. It is these factors that influence digitalization as a phenomenon that creates a new level of development of the economic and social sector, the effectiveness of public administration, corresponding to the concept of Smart State. The present study was carried out using the methods of system approach, as well as statistical and economic analysis. Over the past two decades, Industry 4.0, having impact on organizations, industries, and consumer markets, has created new models of interaction between market participants, i.e. the business environment. © IAEME Publication.</abstract>

      <abstract>Crowd flow prediction has been studied for a variety of purposes,
ranging from the private sector such as location selection of stores
according to the characteristics of commercial districts and
customer-tailored marketing to the public sector for social
infrastructure design such as transportation networks. Its importance is
even greater in light of the spread of contagious diseases such as
COVID-19. In many cases, crowd flow can be divided into subgroups by
common characteristics such as gender, age, location type, etc. If we
use such hierarchical structure of the data effectively, we can improve
prediction accuracy of crowd flow for subgroups. But the existing
prediction models do not consider such hierarchical structure of the
data. In this study, we propose a deep learning model based on
global-local structure of the crowd flow data, which utilizes the
overall(global) and subdivided by the types of sites(local) crowd flow
data simultaneously to predict the crowd flow of each subgroup. The
experiment result shows that the proposed model improves the prediction
accuracy of each sub-divided subgroup by 5.2% (Table 5 Cat #9)-45.95%
(Table 11 Cat #5), depending on the data set. This result comes from
the comparison with the related works under the same condition that use
target category data to predict each subgroup. In addition, when we
refine the global data composition by considering the correlation
between subgroups and excluding low correlated subgroups, the prediction
accuracy is further improved by 5.6-48.65%.</abstract>

      <abstract>Cadastres from the 19th century are a complex as well as rich source for historians and archaeologists, the study of which presents great challenges. For archaeological and historical remote sensing, we have trained several Deep Learning models, CNNs, and Vision Transformers to extract large-scale data from this knowledge representation. We present the principle results of our work here and demonstrate our browser-based tool that allows researchers and public stakeholders to quickly identify spots that featured buildings in the 19th century Franciscean cadastre. The tool not only supports scholars and fellow researchers in building a better understanding of the settlement history of the region of Styria; it also helps public administration and fellow citizens to swiftly identify areas of heightened sensibility with regard to the cultural heritage of the region. © 2024, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

      <abstract>The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has been a strategic and performance
management tool for 30 years, initially for for-profit organizations but
later adopted by other types. This study reviews its use by public
administration scholars, analyzing articles from the Web of Science
database with bibliometric tools and Artificial Intelligence for lexical
and semantic analysis. The analysis concluded that BSC is mainly used in
local government for performance management and measurement. The study
enhances theoretical understanding by exploring BSC&#39;s application in the
public sector, its effectiveness, distinctions from for-profit use, and
identifying areas for further research.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent literature suggests there is a natural connection between innovation and digital transformation, two key topics of interest in management and organization that have spawned large, independent and well-defined areas of study. While this connection might be analytically straightforward and notable examples are not hard to find, in everyday life, it materializes in a multiplicity of ways. A need emerges, then, to better understand the interaction between innovation and digital transformation so that it can be explored and exploited by actors in academia and the public, private and third sectors. In this article, we use a co-word analysis, a text mining technique that permits to systematically map the intellectual structure of a research field, to characterize the most notable dynamics of &#39;innovation-driven digitalization&#39; and &#39;digitalized innovation&#39; - the two major dimensions of interaction between innovation and digital transformation. The text identifies the relevant themes, subthemes and concepts that appear in the literature, as well as their relationship and level of development. It, then, aggregates them in a taxonomy that, on the one hand, readily displays their connection and, on the other hand, (i) informs about current or potential controversies, (ii) gaps, (iii) lines for novel and further research, and (iv) alternatives to bridge to other areas of study.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Automated administrative decision-making in Europe draws attention to legal issues related to its scrutiny. The algorithm may not be an exact translation of the legal norms that it is supposed to enforce; moreover, the logic behind opaque systems is inaccessible to individuals affected by its operation. In the age of mass decisions on access to benefits and public services, how can it be ensured that the legal interest of individuals will be protected? The discussion on general assumptions of administrative justice towards the digital state has already begun in the UK, with some interesting developments on administrative courts’ jurisdiction and evidentiary proceedings. At the same time in the EU, there are discussions on the Proposal for Artificial Intelligence Act resulting in Model Rules on Algorithmic Impact Assessment, with the significant role of the Supervisory Body and the Expert Board. In this paper, I would like to compare two approaches and reflect on them from the viewpoint of Polish administrative justice. To do that, I analyse the English legal framework of judicial review and its recent case law. I conclude that Polish administrative justice doesn’t have the legal competence to evaluate the policymaking process and the role of the court should be limited to examining the decisions of the Supervisory Body. © 2023, Eotvos Lorand Tudomanyegyetem.

      <abstract>This paper discusses how innovations in public sector AI-based services
must comply with the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) regulatory
frameworks while enabling experimentation and participation of diverse
stakeholders throughout the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle. The
paper examines the implications of the emerging regulation, AI
regulatory sandboxes and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) as tools
that facilitate compliance while enabling co-learning and active
participation of multiple stakeholders. We propose a framework that
fosters experimentation with automation pipelines and continuous
monitoring for the deployment of future public sector AI-based services
in a regulatory-compliant and technically innovative manner. AI
regulatory sandboxes can be beneficial as a space for contained
experimentation that goes beyond regulatory considerations to specific
experimentation with the implementation of ML frameworks. While the
paper presents a framework based on emerging regulations, tools and
practices pertaining to the responsible use of AI, this must be
validated through pilot experimentation with public and private
stakeholders and regulators in different areas of high-risk AI-based
services.</abstract>

      <abstract>Performance management, as a systematic and continuous process of planning, measuring and improving performance, is an important endeavor for any organization, regardless of being private or public. To understand the current state of research on performance management, a comprehensive bibliometric study was conducted. This paper aims to provide a co-occurrence analysis to identify and explore clusters, prevailing and emerging themes, and future research directions. For this purpose data was collected from the WoS database and processed with VOSviewer and Microsoft Excel. The paper contains visual representations of clusters, keywords and their relationships, as well as an analysis of the novelty of the concepts. Based on the average published year (APY), the hottest keywords identified are Covid-19 (APY: 2021), followed by Industry 4.0 (APY: 2020.17), together with other 4IR tools (big data analytics, big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cloud, Iot, etc.). Resulting from the analysis of concepts with APY after 2017, in terms of their representativeness (occurrence), links, and total link strengths (TLS) with other items from the map, three concepts significantly emerged: framework (Cluster 1); public sector (Cluster 3); sustainability (Cluster 4). Based on the overall findings, new research directions were proposed.  © 2023 Andra-Teodora Gorski et al., published by Sciendo.</abstract>

      <abstract>This is an ongoing study with the aim to develop a maturity model for efficient deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain (BC) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) public sector. The organizations would leverage this maturity model to assess their efficacy of deploying AI and BC technologies in their operations, highlighting their capabilities for successful integration of these technologies while underscoring their incompetency and directing their attention towards areas of improvement. To achieve this aim, initially the conceptual framework is proposed which would act as primary frame of reference for conducting empirical research in this prospect and developing a maturity model. This study presents the conceptual framework, which highlights the essential dimensions and factors that should be assessed and enhanced for successful implementation of AI and BC technologies. The framework also introduces five stages of maturity&#x2F;development to mark the progress of each dimension of conceptual framework. This conceptual framework is 4x5 grid which vertically presents four dimensions and horizontally it presents five stages of maturity. Strategy &amp; Governance, Technology, People, and Process are dimensions of framework whereas initial, developed, defined, managed and optimized are stages of maturity. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

      <abstract>The importance of data science and big data analytics is growing very fast as organizations are gearing up to leverage their information assets to gain competitive advantage. The flexibility offered through big data analytics empowers functional as well as firm-level performance. In the first phase of the study, we attempt to analyze the research on big data published in high-quality business management journals. The analysis was visualized using tools for big data and text mining to understand the dominant themes and how they are connected. Subsequently, an industry-specific categorization of the studies was done to understand the key use cases. It was found that most of the existing research focuses majorly on consumer discretionary, followed by public administration. Methodologically, a major focus in such exploration is in social media analytics, text mining and machine learning applications for meeting objectives in marketing and supply chain management. However, it was found that not much focus was highlighted in these studies to demonstrate the tools used for the analysis. To address this gap, this study also discusses the evolution, types and usage of big data tools. The brief overview of big data technologies grouped by the services they enable and some of their applications are presented. The study categorizes these tools into big data analysis platforms, databases and data warehouses, programming languages, search tools, and data aggregation and transfer tools. Finally, based on the review, future directions for exploration in big data has been provided for academic and practice. © 2017, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.</abstract>

      <abstract>Being among the largest creators and gatherers of data in many
countries, public administrations are looking for ways to harness big
data technology. However, the de facto uses of big data in the public
sector remain very limited. Despite numerous studies aiming to clarify
the term big data, for many public managers, it remains unclear what
this technology does and does not offer public administration. Using the
concept of technological frames, we explore the assumptions,
expectations, and understandings that public managers possess in order
to interpret and make sense of big data. We identify nine big data
frames, ranging from inward-oriented technoenthusiasts to
outward-oriented techno-skeptics, each of which characterizes public
managers&#39; specific viewpoints relating to the introduction of big data
in public administrations. Our findings highlight inconsistencies
between different perceptions and reveal widespread skepticism among
public managers, helping better understand why the de facto uses of big
data in the public sector remain very limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology that has gained
interest among scholars, politicians, public servants, and citizens. In
the debates on its advantages and risks, issues related to gender have
arisen. In some cases, AI approaches depict a tool to promote gender
equality, and in others, a contribution to perpetuating discrimination
and biases. We develop a theoretical and analytical framework, combining
the literature on technological frames and gender theory to better
understand the gender perspective of the nature, strategy, and use of AI
in two institutional contexts. Our research question is: What are the
assumptions, expectations and knowledge of the European Union
institutions and Spanish government on AI regarding gender?
Methodologically, we conducted a document analysis of 23 official
documents about AI issued by the European Union (EU) and Spain to
understand how they frame the gender perspective in their discourses.
According to our analysis, despite both the EU and Spain have developed
gender-sensitive AI policy frames, doubts remain about the definitions
of key terms and the practical implementation of their discourses.</abstract>

      <abstract>In the twenty-first century, storing and managing digital documents has become commonplace for all corporate and public sectors around the world. Physical documents are scanned in batches and stored in a digital archive as a heterogeneous document stream, referred to as a digital package. To make Robotic Process Automation (RPA) easier, it&#39;s necessary to automatically segment the document stream into a subset of independent, coherent multi-page documents by detecting the appropriate document boundary. It&#39;s a common requirement of a TI company&#39;s Automated Document Management Systems (ADMS), where business operations are automated using RPA and the goal is to extract information from digital documents with minimal user intervention. The current study proposes, evaluates, and compares a multi-modal binary classification network incorporating text and picture aspects of digital document pages to state-of-the-art baseline methodologies. Image and textual features are extracted simultaneously from the input document image by passing them through Visual Geometry Group 16 - Convolutional Neural Network (VGG16-CNN) and pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Legal-BERT _base ) model through transfer learning respectively. Both features are finally fused and passed through a fully connected layer of Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP) to obtain the binary classification of the pages as the First Page (FP) and Other Page (OP). Real-time document image streams from production business process archive were obtained from a reputed Title Insurance (TI) company for the study. The obtained F_1 score of 97.37% and 97.15% are significantly higher than the accuracies of the considered two baseline models and well above the expected Straight Through Pass (STP) threshold defined by the process admin.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>In sustainable and competitive business management, it is crucial for organizations to consider organizational change and transformational leadership in human resource (HR) management to adapt to the changes in their environment. This capability enables large-scale enterprises to maintain their presence in an increasingly competitive environment through enhanced management capacity. Enterprises that adopt transformational leadership in HR management must equip leadership candidates with competencies such as creating a shared vision, providing appropriate role models, encouraging the adoption of group goals, meeting high performance expectations, and providing individual support and the development of intellectual stimulation. By identifying potential leadership candidates using a decision support model, the necessary competencies can be developed through in-service training and experiential learning during their careers. Innovative and effective approaches to identifying leadership candidates can be developed by analyzing complex big data using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this article, a forecast model using machine learning (ML) algorithms for a human resource management career planning approach was developed for the Turkish Post Corporation (PTT) and it was tested to predict potential leadership candidates by analyzing the big data of 5000 employees. The Turkish Post Corporation ML algorithms were applied to 100 randomly selected data points using the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to predict the types of titles held by the staff employed at PTT. The kNN, GB, RF, and SVM algorithms achieved accuracy rates of 96%, 91%, 73%, and 41%, respectively. The case study results indicate that promotion decisions in large-scale and rooted enterprises can be effectively modeled using big data and ML algorithms, highlighting significant potential for HR management and leadership development practices in the public sector. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Grasping the contextual nuances is fundamental for efficacious learning in a novel discipline through internet-based research. Such comprehension significantly augments the decision-making process by promoting well-grounded and informed choices. And with advent of machine learning approaches, it becomes even more fast and robust to enable collaboration between machine algorithms and humans. However, human expertise still holds the key for new domain, which has been proposed in this study as a key step in unsupervised learning approach of k -means clustering technique. Domain search term and context terms for the new domain are added to the clustering technique, and the relevance of the resultant groups has been tested. Context setting helps to analyse and understand the content of documents and other sources of information. For a new domain like algorithmic government, which does not have many documents on the web, it was found that contextual learning was up to 40% more relevant than the normal learning approach. The qualitative aspect of the clusters was found much better by the experts than quantitative aspect due to availability of lesser number of search documents. It was found that scientific research also supports the groups formed during contextual learning approach. This approach should help government to better understand and respond to the needs and concerns of their citizens by deriving better data insights in more quickly and to make more informed, evidence-based decisions that are sensitive to the needs and values of different communities and stakeholders. And thus, many stakeholders in the new domain can use this approach for exploration, research, policy formulation, strategizing, implementing, and testing of the various learned concepts. A total of 15 search engines were used in the experimental settings with thousands of web crawling being done using the Carrot 2 engine. Text embedding was done using bag-of-word technique, and k -means clustering was implemented for producing 25 clusters across the two types of learnings. © 2023 the owner&#x2F;author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>Through the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole globe is in disarray and debating on unique approaches to stop this viral transmission. Masks are being worn by people all around the world as one of the preventative measures to avoid contracting this sickness. Although some people are following and adopting this precaution, others are not, despite official recommendations from the administration and public health organisations has been announced. In this paper DTLMV2 (Deep Transfer Learning MobileNetV2 for the objective of classification) is proposed - A face mask identification model that can reliably determine whether an individual is wearing a mask or not is suggested and implemented in this work. The model architecture employs the peruse of MobileNetV2, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that requires less computing power and can be readily integrated into computer vision and mobile systems. The computer vision with MobileNet is required to formulate a low-cost mask detection system for a group of people in open spaces that can assist in determining whether a person is wearing a mask or not, as well as function as a surveillance system since it is effective on both real-time pictures and videos. The face recognition model obtained 97.01% accuracy on validation data, 98% accuracy on training data and 97.45% accuracy on testing data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed public health policies and human and community behaviors through lockdowns and mandates. Governments are rapidly evolving policies to increase hospital capacity and supply personal protective equipment and other equipment to mitigate disease spread in affected regions. Current models that predict COVID-19 case counts and spread are complex by nature and offer limited explainability and generalizability. This has highlighted the need for accurate and robust outbreak prediction models that balance model parsimony and performance. Objective: We sought to leverage readily accessible data sets extracted from multiple states to train and evaluate a parsimonious predictive model capable of identifying county-level risk of COVID-19 outbreaks on a day-to-day basis. Methods: Our modeling approach leveraged the following data inputs: COVID-19 case counts per county per day and county populations. We developed an outbreak gold standard across California, Indiana, and Iowa. The model utilized a per capita running 7-day sum of the case counts per county per day and the mean cumulative case count to develop baseline values. The model was trained with data recorded between March 1 and August 31, 2020, and tested on data recorded between September 1 and October 31, 2020. Results: The model reported sensitivities of 81%, 92%, and 90% for California, Indiana, and Iowa, respectively. The precision in each state was above 85% while specificity and accuracy scores were generally &gt;95%. Conclusions: Our parsimonious model provides a generalizable and simple alternative approach to outbreak prediction. This methodology can be applied to diverse regions to help state officials and hospitals with resource allocation and to guide risk management, community education, and mitigation strategies. © Agrayan K Gupta, Shaun J Grannis, Suranga N Kasthurirathne.

      <abstract>Objective: The purpose of the study was to identify the basic principles for the development of legal regulation of artificial intelligence, robots, and robotic objects in the field of social relations. Methods: The study subject is international, Russian, and foreign legislation, as well as strategic documents and projects aimed at forming and developing the legal regulation. The authors used legal methods and expert, event, and structural analysis. Results: The article analyzes possible areas of social relations in which artificial intelligence technologies and robotic objects are already applicable; determines terminological issues that do not allow a uniform approach to the legal regulation of artificial intelligence, robots, and robotic objects; formulates proposals for the development of laws in the field of artificial intelligence technologies. Conclusion: The authors have concluded that due to a significant discrepancy in terms and types of artificial intelligence, robots, and robotic objects, it is necessary to develop only the basic principles of legal regulation applicable to all types of artificial intelligence and robotic objects. © 2022, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

      <abstract>There is a thirst for meaning in theory, praxis, and citizenship that knowledge cannot quench. It is time for an affective turn in public administration scholarship, toward an appreciation for the pairing of cognition and emotion, rather than a reliance on cognition alone. For citizens to be engaged with government, they must care about it. It is not spreadsheets that cause people to love their country or hate it; it is feelings. Societal faultlines will not be healed by Big Data. The feeling that citizens have for their government must be both the beginning point and end point of the citizen-state encounter. The emotive component to governance is its connective tissue and the articles in this special issue demonstrate how it can inform theory, research, and practice. © 2018, Copyright © 2018 Public Administration Theory Network.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper empirically analyses the impacts of the digital
transformation process in the business and public sectors on energy
security (ES). We employ 8 indicators to represent four aspects of
energy security, including availability, acceptability, develop-ability,
and sustainability. Digital businesses development is captured by
e-Commerce (including e-Commerce sales, e-Commerce turnover, e-Commerce
web sales) and e-Business (including customer relation management (CRM)
usage and cloud usage). Digital public services development is reflected
by business mobility and key enablers. Different econometric techniques
are utilized in a database of 24 European Union countries from 2011 to
2019. Our estimation results demonstrate that digital businesses play a
critical role in improving the acceptability and develop-ability of
energy security, while digitalization in public services supports
achieving energy sustainability goals. The use of modern digital
technology such as big data, cloud computing is extremely important to
ensure the security of the energy system, especially the availability of
energy. For further discussion on the role of digital public services,
we reveal a nonlinear association between digitalization in the public
sector and energy intensity and energy consumption, suggesting the
acceptability and develop-ability of energy security can be enhanced if
the digital transformation process achieves a certain level.</abstract>

      <abstract>The importance of robots for industry, research, education, and society as a whole is steadily increasing as reflected by the number of available systems and installed robots, not only in industry but also in the public sector and households. Software-only robotics researchers usually rely on commercially available robots which, in the case of manipulators, are primarily designed for industrial purposes and are often far from their needs. This article is a hands-on tutorial on the Franka Emika robot, the first series of industrial artificial intelligence (AI)-ready tactile robot platforms. Beyond industrial use, the systems can be seamlessly expanded to fulfill the demands of research and education across all robotics and AI disciplines. To satisfy the needs of such a wide variety of fields, it provides three different interfaces: Desk, a high-level app-based user interface for easy and fast task programming; Robot Integrated Development Environment (RIDE), a command-based programming environment used to create high-performance robot skills that enables programming custom apps and integrating external sensors; and the Franka control interface (FCI), a 1-kHz low-level torque and position control interface that exploits the also-Available Langrangian dynamics robot model. We take a close look at implementations with all interfaces, ranging from simple solutions, apps, and controllers to robot-learning examples illustrating how to exploit all the advantages of this platform in ongoing robotics research and education.  © 1994-2011 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in almost
every aspect of our lives. At the same time, a debate about its
applications, safety, and privacy is raging. In three studies, we
explored how UK respondents perceive the usage of AI in various public
sector decisions. Our results are fourfold. First, we found that people
prefer AI to have considerably less decisional weight than various human
decision-makers; those being: politicians, citizens, and (human)
experts. Secondly, our findings revealed that people prefer AI to
provide input and advice to these human decision-makers, rather than
letting AI make decisions by itself. Thirdly, although AI is seen as
contributing less to perceived legitimacy than these human
decision-makers, similar to (human) experts, its contribution is seen
more in terms of output legitimacy than in terms of input and throughput
legitimacy. Finally, our results suggest that the involvement of AI is
perceived more suitable for decisions that are low (instead of high)
ideologically-charged. Overall, our findings thus show that people are
rather skeptical towards using AI in the public domain, but this does
not imply that they want to exclude AI entirely from the decision-making
process.</abstract>

      <abstract>In April 2021 Stavå bridge, a main bridge on E6 in Norway, was abruptly closed for traffic. A structural defect had seriously compromised the bridge’s structural integrity. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) closed it, made a temporary solution and reopened with severe traffic restrictions. The incident was alerted through what constitutes the bridge’s Digital Twin processing data from Internet of Things sensors. The solution was crucial in online and offline diagnostics, the case demonstrating the value of technologies to tackle emerging dangerous situations as well as acting preventively. A critical and rapidly developing damage was detected in time to stop the development, but not in time to avoid the incident altogether. The paper puts risk in a broader perspective for an organization responsible for highway infrastructure. It positions online monitoring and Digital Twins in the context of Risk- and Condition-Based Maintenance. The situation that arose at Stavå bridge, and how it was detected, analysed, and diagnosed during virtual inspection, is described. The case demonstrates how combining physics-based methods with Machine Learning can facilitate damage detection and diagnostics. A summary of lessons learnt, both from technical and organisational perspectives, as well as plans of future work, is presented. © 2024 The Author(s).

      <abstract>The quality of the data in core electronic registers has constantly decreased as a result of numerous errors that were made and inconsistencies in the data in these databases due to the growing number of databases created with the intention of providing electronic services for public administration and the lack of the data harmonization or interoperability between these databases. Evaluating and improving the quality of data by matching and linking records from multiple data sources becomes exceedingly difficult due to the incredibly large volume of data in these numerous data sources with different data architectures and no unique field to create interconnection among them. Different algorithms are developed to treat these issues and our focus will be on algorithms that handle large amounts of data, such as Levenshtein distance (LV) algorithm and Damerau-Levenshtein distance (DL) algorithm. In order to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness and quality of data using the mentioned algorithms and making improvements to these algorithms, through this paper we will conduct experiments on large data sets with more than one million records. © 2023, International journal of online and biomedical engineering.

      <abstract>Objectives: To identify the potential opportunities and risks around future UK regulatory reform of medical devices. Design: A mixed methods approach, comprising a rapid literature review, one-to-one, semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, a multidisciplinary stakeholder workshop, and a post-workshop survey. Setting: United Kingdom. Participants: 32 key stakeholders across the medical device sector were identified both from the public and private sectors. Results: Opportunities relating to regulatory independence were identified, including the potential to create and implement a regulatory framework that ensures availability of medical devices; innovation and investment potential; and safety to the citizens of the UK. The most significant risks identified included threats to the safety of individual patients and the wider health system arising from the delay in awaiting regulatory approval due to the shortage of approved bodies; and reduced competitiveness of UK market and device manufacturers. Recommendations were identified to mitigate risks, centred on harnessing broader cross-sector collaborations, promoting patient and public partnership, and maximizing international engagement. Conclusions: The UK’s medical device sector is at a time-critical juncture to construct a regulatory framework to navigate its exit of Europe and respond to Europe&#39;s transition to new medical device regulations whilst also addressing the ongoing demand for rapid approval for new devices in response to the global pandemic. Investment, capacity-building, and international engagement will play a central role in mitigating risks and maximizing opportunities for medical device regulation. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a grave global public health emergency. Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management. © 2020 by the authors.

      <abstract>A survey of Hong Kong residents finds that public support for government
technology, as understood through the concept of smart cities, is
associated with concept -awareness and official communications. The
statistical analysis identifies moderating effects attributable to
personal social media use and controls for personal ideological views
about scope of government intervention and perceived political
legitimacy of smart city policies. The study builds on a growing body of
empirical scholarship about public support for government technology,
while also addressing a practical trend in urban governance: the growing
sophistication of technologies like artificial intelligence and their
use in strengthening government capacities. The Hong Kong case
exemplifies ambitious investments in technology by governments and, at
the time of the survey, relatively high freedom of political expression.
The study&#39;s findings help refine theories about state -society relations
in the rapidly evolving context of technology for public sector use.
Policy Significance Statement This study offers empirical evidence about
factors that influence the political legitimacy of government
technology, including the effect of concept -awareness and public
communication. Findings imply that message credibility and comprehension
are instrumental in crafting policy narratives and that participatory co
-construction of these narratives can strengthen the political
legitimacy of government technology.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article argues for a population level of analysis, addressing a theoretical and empirical gap and enabling the analysis of transition, tempo, and timing at the macro level. The article examines four theories of population-level innovation: population ecology, neo-institutional theory, innovation diffusion, and population-level learning theory. A population-level empirical study of innovation and organizational learning addresses three research questions: the first and second examine patterns of innovation underpinned by learning over space and over time. The third concerns the processes and dynamics of those patterns. The data derive from the local government using mixed methods and multiple respondents over 9 years. The research shows the uneven spread of learning across the population, with the emergence of two subpopulations. Over time, innovation and learning strategies shifted. Learning in the population occurred through both direct interaction and vicarious learning from others in the population. Implications for population-level theory, innovation, and learning are explored. © 2021 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>Algorithms are increasingly used in different domains of public policy.
They help humans to profile unemployed, support administrations to
detect tax fraud and give recidivism risk scores that judges or criminal
justice managers take into account when they make bail decisions. In
recent years, critics have increasingly pointed to ethical challenges of
these tools and emphasized problems of discrimination, opaqueness or
accountability, and computer scientists have proposed technical
solutions to these issues. In contrast to these important debates, the
literature on how these tools are implemented in the actual everyday
decision-making process has remained cursory. This is problematic
because the consequences of ADM systems are at least as dependent on the
implementation in an actual decision-making context as on their
technical features. In this study, we show how the introduction of risk
assessment tools in the criminal justice sector on the local level in
the USA has deeply transformed the decision-making process. We argue
that this is mainly due to the fact that the evidence generated by the
algorithm introduces a notion of statistical prediction to a situation
which was dominated by fundamental uncertainty about the outcome before.
While this expectation is supported by the case study evidence, the
possibility to shift blame to the algorithm does seem much less
important to the criminal justice actors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Information and communication technologies (ICT) have a recent impact on governance and public administration. Electronic government (e-government) services were created to streamline administrative processes and enhance citizen engagement on the one hand, and to build new governance models that would empower individuals, involve them in the decision-making process, and increase transparency on the other. Many individuals are doubtful about smart city projects because of the security issues that arise in such environments. In essence, internet of things gadgets are security flaws. Concerns about the proliferation of IoT sensors and the tighter coupling of infrastructure silos in cities are well-founded. The major objective of the study is to identify the influencing factors of smart cities on e-government in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, this research explores the definition of e-government, and its supporting technologies like smart cities, IoT, big data, cloud computing and other digital government platforms. After exploring the detailed definitions, the study identifies the challenging scenarios of e-government in Saudi Arabia, and discusses the different opportunities. This study also concentrates on the good practices to be followed to overcome the challenges. Furthermore, this study can be used in future research for solving real time challenges of e-government. © 2024 The Authors</abstract>

      <abstract>One of the primary components of innovation management in research and development (R&amp;D) organizations is project selection. In public sector R&amp;D environments, it is essential that improvements are made to the selection processes. These improvements should address the unique challenges faced by these organizations in order to increase the quality of the decisions that are made. Modern decision support systems (DSS) have the potential to meet these needs. The implementation of effective DSS backed by solid data management practices and driven by artificial intelligence technologies has the potential to enhance the management of public sector R&amp;D innovation.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Design innovation projects often generate large numbers of design ideas from designers, users, and, increasingly, the crowd over the Internet. Such idea data are often used for selection and implementation but, in fact, can 1also be used as sources of inspiration for further idea generation. In particular, the elementary concepts that underlie the original ideas can be recombined to generate new ideas. But it is not a trivial task to retrieve concepts from raw lists of ideas and data sources in a manner that can stimulate or generate new ideas. A significant difficulty lies in the fact that idea data are often expressed in unstructured natural languages. This paper develops a methodology that uses natural language processing to extract key words as elementary concepts embedded in massive idea descriptions and represents the elementary concept space in a core-periphery structure to direct the recombination of elementary concepts into new ideas. We apply the methodology to mine and represent the concept space underlying massive crowdsourced ideas and use it to generate new ideas for future transportation system designs in a real public sector-sponsored project via humans and automated computer programs. Our analysis of the human and computer recombination processes and outcomes sheds light on future research directions for artificial intelligence in design ideation.  © 2019 by ASME.</abstract>

      <abstract>Motivation: Datafication—the growing presence, use and impact of data in social processes—is spreading to all sectors in developing countries. But, to date, there are few analyses of real-world experiences of datafication in developing country organizations. Purpose: We address this knowledge gap by analysing evidence of big data in practice in relation to three key issues: implementation, value and power. Approach and methods: Using interview, observation and documentary sources, we analyse the implementation and impact of big data systems in Indian electricity and transport public sector organizations. Findings: Big data systems have been much slower to implement than anticipated, and the article exposes the nature and scale of the implementation challenge facing such systems. These are already delivering value for some managers within public service organizations but are, as yet, more operational than strategic and incremental not transformative. Big data systems are facilitating a shift in power from the public sector to the private sector, and from labour and middle management to panopticon-type control by central managers. Big data intersects with politics especially around the imaginaries of wider stakeholders, changing their view of the financial and political issues that technology can address. Policy implications: Policy-makers and practitioners can better understand and plan for big data in development using three frameworks presented in the article: information value chain, decision pyramid, and big data–power model. These expose key issues of implementation, organizational value and power that must be incorporated into big data policy and projects. Benefits of datafication have been largely restricted to senior managers, private contractors and some politicians. To spread these to other stakeholders, including workers and citizens, action must be taken to address both practical and political issues arising in the datafication of development. © The Authors 2019.

      <abstract>Although artificial intelligence is the product of science-fiction literature, it currently represents a significant branch of computer science dealing with intelligent behavior, machine learning, and machine adaptation. It has become a discipline that attempts to answer real-world problems. Artificial intelligence systems are nowadays widely used in economics and medicine, design or military. The role of archives is changing worldwide. In this grandiose transformation, archives need to be at the forefront of their own future, so that they can steer, guide, and not lose out. The vast masses of information in archives provide an excellent platform forthe exploitation of artificial intelligence. The mass of data can be a great help not only for research but also for policy preparation and in some areas of public administration in the not too distant future. © 2020 International Institute for Archival Science Trieste - Maribor.

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence arising from the use of machine learning is
rapidly being developed and deployed by governments to enhance
operations, public services, and compliance and security activities.
This article reviews how artificial intelligence is being used in public
sector for automated decision making, for chatbots to provide
information and advice, and for public safety and security. It then
outlines four public administration challenges to deploying artificial
intelligence in public administration: accuracy, bias and
discrimination; legality, due process and administrative justice;
responsibility, accountability, transparency and explainability; and
power, compliance and control. The article outlines technological and
governance innovations that are being developed to address these
challenges.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent policies and research articles call for turning AI into a form of IA (‘intelligence augmentation’), by envisioning systems that center on and enhance humans. Based on a field study at an AI company, this article studies how AI is performed as developers enact two predictive systems along with stakeholders in public sector accounting and public sector healthcare. Inspired by STS theories about values in design, we analyze our empirical data focusing especially on how objectives, structured performances, and divisions of labor are built into the two systems and at whose expense. Our findings reveal that the development of the two AI systems is informed by politically motivated managerial interests in cost-efficiency. This results in AI systems that are (1) designed as managerial tools meant to enable efficiency improvements and cost reductions, and (2) enforced on professionals on the ‘shop floor’ in a top-down manner. Based on our findings and a discussion drawing on literature on the original visions of human-centered systems design from the 1960s, we argue that turning AI into IA seems dubious, and ask what human-centered AI really means and whether it remains an ideal not easily realizable in practice. More work should be done to rethink human-machine relationships in the age of big data and AI, in this way making the call for ethical and responsible AI more genuine and trustworthy. © The Author(s) 2023.</abstract>

      <abstract>The risk of non-fulfilment of a contract can harm public administration
or even interrupt public services. Therefore, models that assist manager
decision making in the audit and control of contracts with a higher
disqualification risk may be important tools, with economic and even
social repercussions. In this article, public contracts are classified
with respect to the risk of non-compliance with their terms of delivery.
The quantitative tools used are statistical and machine learning models,
similar to credit risk rating of loans. As dependent variables, the
models use data found in electronic databases present in e-government
implementations. A previously classified listing of suspended companies
is used as a proxy for risky contracts, as it contains private companies
which failed with their contractual obligations. The classification
techniques utilized are logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours,
discriminant analysis, support vector machine and random forests.
Although the methods can be applied to any government with electronic
procurement and contracts systems, Brazilian data is used to illustrate
the benefits of contract governance for emerging economies. It is
concluded that the credit rating techniques used directly apply to
contractual risk in public administration. Considering real public
administration contract data, the classification algorithm that
generates the best performance is k-nearest neighbours.</abstract>

      <abstract>The problem discussed in this paper is the paradox associated with hundreds of contributions of the scientific community over three decades, mainly leveraged by the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM) and its perspectives, but whose benefits arising from its applicability to the real world are scarce. The context of public sector organizations, which does not fit into any of the four perspectives presented by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993), led to the intertwining of the theme with Data Science. The hypothesis formulation involves interconnecting convergent concepts, namely through the adoption of a replicable framework in any world-wide public services, to potentiate the change of perspective, allowing to achieve the desired strategic alignment (IT-Business). It is hoped that the suggestions and recommendations can contribute to leverage significant changes in the Public Sector context in order to optimize the services provided, anticipating the citizen’s needs.

      <abstract>Public entities around the world are increasingly deploying artificial
intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision-making systems to provide
public services or to use their enforcement powers. The rationale for
the public sector to use these systems is similar to private sector:
increase efficiency and speed of transactions and lower the costs.
However, public entities are first and foremost established to meet the
needs of the members of society and protect the safety, fundamental
rights, and wellbeing of those they serve. Currently AI systems are
deployed by the public sector at various administrative levels without
robust due diligence, monitoring, or transparency. This paper critically
maps out the challenges in procurement of AI systems by public entities
and the long-term implications necessitating AI-specific procurement
guidelines and processes. This dual-prong exploration includes the new
complexities and risks introduced by AI systems, and the institutional
capabilities impacting the decision-making process. AI-specific public
procurement guidelines are urgently needed to protect fundamental rights
and due process.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper argues against the call to democratize artificial
intelligence (AI). Several authors demand to reap purported benefits
that rest in direct and broad participation: In the governance of AI,
more people should be more involved in more decisions about AI-from
development and design to deployment. This paper opposes this call. The
paper presents five objections against broadening and deepening public
participation in the governance of AI. The paper begins by reviewing the
literature and carving out a set of claims that are associated with the
call to &#x60;&#x60;democratize AI&#39;&#39;. It then argues that such a democratization
of AI (1) rests on weak grounds, because it does not answer to a demand
of legitimization, (2) is redundant in that it overlaps with existing
governance structures, (3) is resource intensive, which leads to
injustices, (4) is morally myopic and thereby creates popular oversights
and moral problems of its own, and finally, (5) is neither theoretically
nor practically the right kind of response to the injustices that
animate the call. The paper concludes by suggesting that AI should be
democratized not by broadening and deepening participation but by
increasing the democratic quality of the administrative and executive
elements of collective decision making. In a slogan: The question is not
so much whether AI should be democratized but how.</abstract>

      <abstract>Despite the prolific introduction of ethical frameworks, empirical research on AI ethics in the public sector is limited. This empirical research investigates how the ethics of AI is translated into practice and the challenges of its implementation by public service organizations. Using the Value Sensitive Design as a framework of inquiry, semi-structured interviews are conducted with eight public service organizations across the Estonian government that have piloted or developed an AI solution for delivering a public service. Results show that the practical application of AI ethical principles is indirectly considered and demonstrated in different ways in the design and development of the AI. However, translation of these principles varies according to the maturity of the AI and the public servant’s level of awareness, knowledge, and competences in AI. Data-related challenges persist as public service organizations work on fine-tuning their AI applications. © 2023 IGI Global. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>In recent days, social media plays a significant role in the ecosystem
of the big data world and its different types of information. There is
an emerging need for collection, monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing
the different information from various social media platforms in
different domains like businesses, public administration, and others.
Social media acts as the representative with numerous microblogs for
analytics. Predictive analytics of such microblogs provides insights
into various aspects of the real-world entities. In this article, a
predictive model is proposed using the tweets generated on Twitter
social media. The proposed model calculates the potential of a topic in
the tweets for the prediction purposes. The experiments were conducted
on tweets of the regional election in India and the results are better
than the existing systems. In the future, the model can be extended for
analysis of information diffusion in heterogeneous systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>The growing use of automated decision-making (ADM) systems in the public sector and the need to control these has raised many legal questions in academic research and in policymaking. One of the timely means of legal control is accountability, which traditionally includes the ability to impose sanctions on the violator as one dimension. Even though many risks regarding the use of ADM have been noted and there is a common will to promote the safety of these systems, the relevance of the safety research has been discussed little in this context. In this article, I evaluate regulating accountability over the use of ADM in the public sector in relation to the findings of safety research. I conducted the study by focusing on ongoing regulatory projects regarding ADM, the Finnish ADM legislation draft and the EU proposal for the AI Act. The critical question raised in the article is what the role of sanctions is. I ask if official accountability could mean more of an opportunity to learn from mistakes, share knowledge and compensate for harm instead of control via sanctions. © The Author(s) 2023.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study has examined factors, such as technology and employee influence on artificial intelligence (AI) adoption of e-innovative projects in the United Arab Emirates. The present study revealed the success or failure of e-innovation adoption in the public sector of the UAE and hinted at potential e-innovative projects to consider essential factors before adopting it. The study&#39;s sample covered the government sector, and the data collection method was a survey questionnaire with a sample size of 1037 responses made up of government employees. This paper was mainly built upon the diffusion of innovation and technology acceptance theories. The analysis findings showed that technology (an external factor) significantly and positively contributed to adopting AI e-innovation technology. Further analysis revealed that employee (internal factor) proxies directly influenced the adoption of AI e-innovation technology. Overall, internal and external factors contributed to adopting e-innovation technology in the United Arab Emirates. For future directions, additional factors related to the market should be considered to explore their contribution. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.</abstract>

      <abstract>New energy technologies may fail to make the transition to the market once research funding has ended due to a lack of private engagement to conclude their development. Extending public funding to cover such experimental developments could be one way to improve this transition. However, identifying promising research and development (R&amp;D) proposals for this purpose is a difficult task for the following reasons: Close-to-market implementations regularly require substantial resources while public budgets are limited; the allocation of public funds needs to be fair, open, and documented; the evaluation is complex and subject to public sector regulations for public engagement in R&amp;D funding. This calls for a rigorous evaluation process. This paper proposes an operational three-staged decision support system (DSS) to assist decision-makers in public funding institutions in the ex-ante evaluation of R&amp;D proposals for large-scale close-to-market projects in energy research. The system was developed based on a review of literature and related approaches from practice combined with a series of workshops with practitioners from German public funding institutions. The results confirm that the decision-making process is a complex one that is not limited to simply scoring R&amp;D proposals. Decision-makers also have to deal with various additional issues such as determining the state of technological development, verifying market failures or considering existing funding portfolios. The DSS that is suggested in this paper is unique in the sense that it goes beyond mere multi-criteria aggregation procedures and addresses these issues as well to help guide decision-makers in public institutions through the evaluation process. © 2018 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Governments worldwide are strategically investing in artificial
intelligence (AI) to improve public services and streamline internal
operations. In this context, national AI strategies play a pivotal role.
This study uses combined qualitative research methods analyzing 28
national AI strategies (i.e., the texts). Our aim is to delve into how
governments define and position AI applications within the public
sector. Specifically, the study explores how the texts convey AI&#39;s
application in this context employing a public value(s) perspective. Its
discursive analytical approach coupled with a comprehensive take on
public value theory (Moore, 1995) engenders novel insights into national
discourses on AI in the public sector. Against this background we draw
on public administration and policy research in our analysis of three
dominant discourses that we identify in the texts, i.e. empowerment
through information, enhanced administrative practices, and improved
service delivery. We find that the discourses involve different
positions in relation to governments&#39; use of AI and depend on particular
actors and types of public service. Commonly, they concern government
objectives to tackle critical societal issues through AI, such as in the
areas of health and social care and employment. In particular, the
discourse of enhanced administrative practices commonly positioned AI as
a tool to optimize internal processes, resource allocation, and
organizational management. On the other hand, the discourse of improved
service delivery similarly placed public services front and center,
while the discourse of empowerment through information framed AI as
being able to enhance citizens&#39; service experiences. Interestingly,
discourses emphasizing the policymaking function, i.e., AI applied to
the development of public policy,-receives limited attention. Our
findings underscore strategic prioritizations. While efficiency and
service delivery dominate the discourse, citizen engagement remains
underemphasized. We argue that policymakers must strike a balance,
ensuring AI aligns with broader societal outcomes while addressing
democratic imperatives.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper studies data work in an organizational context, and suggests speculative data work as a useful concept and the speculative dashboard as a design concept, to better understand and support cooperative work. Drawing on fieldwork in a Danish public sector organisation, the paper identifies and conceptualizes the speculative data work performed around processes of digitalization and the push to become data-driven. The speculative dashboard is proposed as a design concept and opportunity for design, using practices from speculative design and research to facilitate speculation about data?its sources, visualizations, practices and infrastructures. It does so by hacking the &#39;genre&#39; of the business intelligence data dashboard, and using it as a framework for the juxtaposition of different kinds of data, facilitating and encouraging speculation on alternative visions for data types and use. The paper contributes an empirical study of organizational use of and attitudes towards data, informing a novel design method and concept for co-speculating on alternative visions of and for organizational data.  © 2021 ACM.</abstract>

      <abstract>Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is becoming more and more prevalent in everyday life. Due to their promise of producing faster, better, and less biased decisions, automated and data-driven processes also receive increasing attention in many different administrative settings. However, as a result of human mistakes ADM also poses the threat of producing unfair outcomes. Looming algorithmic discrimination can undermine the legitimacy of administrative decision-making. While lawyers and lawmakers face the age-old question of regulation, many decision-makers tasked with designing ADM for and implementing ADM in public administration wrestle with harnessing its advantages and limiting its disadvantages. &quot;Algorithmic fairness&quot;has evolved as key concept in developing algorithmic systems to counter detrimental outcomes. We provide a review of the vast literature on algorithmic fairness and show how key dimensions alter people&#39;s perception of whether an algorithm is fair. In doing so, we provide entry point into this literature for anybody who is required to think about algorithmic fairness, particularly in an public administration context. We also pinpoint critical concerns about algorithmic fairness that public officials and researchers should note.  © 2024 The Authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study explores the determinants of digital innovation in the public
sector. Focusing specifically on new digital technologies, such as big
data, artificial intelligence, Internet of things, and augmented
reality, we explained the wide variation in how Korean local governments
used these technologies to transform their services. We found support
for four theoretical mechanisms. First, our findings support the
existence of demand-pull innovation in the public sector: public
organizations respond to citizen demands or needs for innovation.
Second, we also find support for an electoral incentive hypothesis,
which posits that local governments&#39; motivation for digital innovation
is influenced by local politicians&#39; electoral incentives. Third, our
results show the existence of isomorphic pressure as a driver for public
sector innovation: public organizations emulate their neighbors in
adopting innovative practices. Fourth, the results support the upper
echelons theory, as younger policymakers are more active innovators.</abstract>

      <abstract>As we stand at the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain, Robotics, 3D technologies, and many more have become the means and solutions to many of the world’s problems. Most recently, these technologies have assisted in the global fight of the COVID-19 pandemic and other societal problems. Together with these innovative techniques, the concept of circular economy and its relevant tools such as life cycle costing, life cycle impact assessment, materials passports, and circularity measurements have been implemented in a number of sectors in different countries for the transition from a linear “take, make, and dispose” model towards a more circular model, which has shown positive results for the environment and economy. In this article, with the help of implementation, prototyping, and case studies, we explore how these technological advancements and innovative techniques are used in different sectors such as information and communications technology, the built environment, mining and manufacturing, education, healthcare, the public sectors, and others to provide an opportunity to understand and resolve the agreed upon framework in 2015 by 193 countries, that is, the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. © 2020 by the authors.

      <abstract>This paper reports on the findings of an international workshop organised by the UK-France+ Genomics and Ethics Network (UK-FR + GENE) in 2022. The focus of the workshop were the ethical and social issues raised by public-private partnerships in the context of large-scale genomics initiatives in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel, i.e. collaborations where commercial entities are given access to publicly held genomic data. While the public sector relies on partnerships with commercial entities to exploit the full potential of the data it holds, such collaborations may have an impact on the return of benefits to the public sector and on public trust, and subsequently challenge the social contract. The first part of this paper explores the ways in which the four countries examined respond to the challenges posed to the social contract, and what safeguards they put in place to secure public trust. The second part presents three approaches to address the challenges of private-public partnerships in secondary data use. In conclusion, this paper offers a set of minimum requirements for these partnerships within solidarity-based publicly funded healthcare systems. These include the necessity of public-private partnerships to (1) contribute to the public benefit and minimise harm produced by the use of publicly held data; (2) avoid prioritisation of commercial interests over robust governance structures to guarantee benefits to the public and protect donors, especially marginalised groups; (3) side-step the pitfalls of the rhetoric of solidarity and be transparent about the challenges to return the benefits to ‘all’. © The Author(s) 2024.</abstract>

      <abstract>The political dimension of crisis communication remains understudied in
public administration. We defined the politicization of government
crisis communication as the employment of politics-oriented
communication strategies in crisis messaging. We further examined the
state-level politicization occurring during COVID-19 and its influence
on public engagement and policy compliance. We applied machine learning
algorithms to analyze 43,642 Twitter messages posted by fifty US state
governors, assessing the extent to which these governors politicized
crisis communication. We compiled data from multiple sources to explore
the influence of communication politicization on public engagement and
compliance behaviors. While most governors showed major concerns
regarding reputation and blame, their level of politicization and
selection of communication strategies varied. Increased levels of
communication politicization discouraged the public&#39;s online engagement
and policy compliance. Excessive levels of political consideration could
undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of government crisis
communication, and thus an examination of their relationship was
essential.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: This study aims to address three important issues of combination forecasting in the tourism context: reducing the restrictions arising from requirements related to the statistical properties of the available data, assessing the weights of single models and considering nonlinear relationships among combinations of single-model forecasts. Design Methodology Approach: A three-stage multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM)-based methodological framework was proposed. Single-model forecasts were generated by grey prediction models for the first stage. Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje was adopted to develop a weighting scheme in the second stage, and the Choquet integral was used to combine forecasts nonlinearly in the third stage. Findings: The empirical results for inbound tourism in Taiwan showed that the proposed method can significantly improve accuracy to a greater extent than other combination methods. Along with scenario forecasting, a good forecasting practice can be further provided by estimating ex-ante forecasts post-COVID-19. Practical Implications: The private and public sectors in economies with high tourism dependency can benefit from the proposed method by using the forecasts to help them formulate tourism strategies. Originality Value: This study contributed to presenting a MADM-based framework that advances the development of a more accurate combination method for tourism forecasting. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article tests whether managers and staff evaluate artificial
intelligence (AI)-based process innovations differently. Scholars have
argued perceptions of innovation vary systematically as a function of an
individual&#39;s position within organisations. We test for attitudinal
differences between managers and staff via an online experimental
simulation fielded among working-age Taiwanese citizens employed in
public sector employment (n &#x3D; 600). Respondents engage in a 12-round
simulation. We experimentally vary whether the respondent receives
support from an AI decision support tool. We assess pre-intervention and
post-intervention attitudes towards the use of AI for a suite of
organisational tasks, using a difference-in-difference estimation
approach to identify the causal effect of organisational position on
innovation evaluation. Our findings suggest managers are more supportive
of AI as a decision support tool than staff, and remain so after the
simulation. Managers also increased their support of AI tools to a
larger degree than staff.</abstract>

      <abstract>Most recent discussion of the adaptive reuse of school land has focused almost exclusively on repurposing or redeploying vacant school space rather than comprehensively re-planning and constructing the entire school land for the overall needs of society and urban development. The relevant government agencies for school land reuse in Taiwan, such as the Ministry of Education and municipal governments, mostly provide subjective regulations or revitalization provisions for the sustainable development of school resources; however, no specific scientific assessment or a planning procedure has been proposed to revitalize school land. Therefore, constructing a scientific, quantitative, and objective planning framework and procedure is necessary for the adaptive reuse of school land based on the needs of overall society and urban development in order to replace the existing and outdated planning philosophy and to correct prominent shortcomings of past planning operations that were solely in accordance with the qualitative judgment and decision making of official agencies. In this study, we mainly adopted the analytic network process (ANP) and big data, including demographics, facility usage, and social welfare indicators, to assist the Taipei City government to construct or reform land reuse strategies for junior high and elementary schools facing immediate or future closure, consolidation, or downsizing. To take a more realistic approach to improve final decision making, the investigation of expert questionnaires through the ANP was based on the consideration of future trends that were objectively evaluated by big datasets. The novel planning philosophy and concise decision framework for reuse strategies we designed are expected to improve public decision-making transparency, adaptive reuse effectiveness, and quality of urban life. Ultimately, our proposed strategies and suggestions can not only assist local public sectors to promote the policy of adaptive reuse of surplus school lands but also serve as an appropriate blueprint of urban sustainability for the central government in the near future. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.</abstract>

      <abstract>The technological capabilities of Human Resource Analytics (HRA), enhanced by recent innovations in Machine Learning (ML), offer exciting opportunities. However, organisations often fail to realise these potentials because of a limited understanding of why individuals choose to adopt or disregard respective tools. Prior research on innovation adoption offers preliminary insights but fails to aggregate the determinants of individual adoption into actionable suggestions for decisions in the ML adoption process. Our study applies focused interviews to examine non-ML experts&#39; reasoning for using a specific tool tailored to a public sector organisation, which corresponds to the usual end-user perspective of ML-based HRA adoption. By drawing from the HRA adoption framework, provided by Vargas et al. (2018), we contribute to the literature by identifying relevant beliefs and experiences influencing one&#39;s intention to adopt ML-based HRA and by qualitatively linking these beliefs to ML characteristics such as transparency, automation and fairness. For practitioners, we provide actionable guidance emphasising the need to ensure fairness proactively, as interviewees do not consider this aspect when deciding to adopt ML-based HRA. © 2024 The Authors</abstract>

      <abstract>As an important public facility in cities, hospitals provide services that are vital to people’s lives. Big data is representative of geographic data from numerous sources. It has the advantages of large amounts of data, high timeliness, and abundant information, which may compensate for the inadequacy of traditional planning and design, which is overly subjective. Big data can be used to obtain large-scale human movement data to study hospital characteristics from a supply–demand balance perspective. Here, 182 comprehensive hospitals in three districts of Shenzhen were picked as an example, and multi-source data were introduced as a quantitative assessment tool to analyze them. First, the mobile public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) was researched and developed independently and used to collect volunteered geographic information (VGI) data, which was adopted to quantify hospital service supply. Second, the population’s demand for hospitals was characterized by the quantified point of interest (POI) data. Finally, the location entropy method was utilized to quantify the levels of supply and demand for comprehensive hospital services from a supply–demand balance perspective, which was used to guide the classification of the comprehensive hospitals. The result shows that: (1) the service scopes and the service pressure are different for the same type of comprehensive hospitals classified by the traditional method; (2) the spatial distribution of patients is related to land function; (3) the overlap area between the part with a high service pressure level in the comprehensive hospital and the part with high medical demand of the patient is prone to service blindness. This study paves a new way to optimize the spatial allocation of medical institutions or other types of public facilities, rationalize resource allocation, and alleviate urban transportation congestion. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The current research conceptualizes and validates a model concentrating on how policy initiatives foster the big data management capabilities (BDMC) to achieve sustainability. Additionally, it also pursues to delve into the mediation mechanism of Global brain reflective management accounting practices (GBAP) in the linkage between BDMC and sustainability. Outstandingly, it makes several endeavors to deepen insight on whether the extent of the effect of BDMC on GBAP and the effect of GBAP on sustainability vary resting on specific degree of innovation human resource management (IHRM). The statistical data of a convenient and snowball sample of 612 participants was gathered from a structured and close-ended questionnaire survey. In order to bring forth the proposed hypothesized interconnections, the fundamental analytical instrument utilized was structural equation modeling (SEM). Additionally, multi-group SEM analysis was also applied to corroborate the moderating effects of IHRM. Beyond ameliorating the insight into how intersection of accounting practices and new technologies could make a huge contribution to BDMC enhancement to reach the sustainability paradigm, the observations of this research gave rise to the practical implications for the practitioners in organizational management and policy-makers in promulgating rules in relation to digital transformation implementation within small and medium enterprises. © International Journal of Economics and Management.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study proposes a framework of data-driven administration built on both data and value dimensions and thereby suggests four possible types arising from cases (data-rich and value neutral, data-rich and value-controversial, data-poor and value-neutral, and data-poor and value-controversial). Using an exploratory case study approach, we discuss data-driven administration in the perspective of evidence-based policy-making. Following the tradition of evidence-based policy-making, the advancement of data analytics promotes data-driven administration to solve social problems and innovate government operations. We review relevant cases in Korea and then illustrates how the combinations of two dimensions make practices of data-driven administration successful or not. There is little study pointing out to be mindful of values embedded with social issues in certain domains, even when approached with data-driven administration. The framework of data-driven administration can be used for the better understanding of increasing data analytics practices in the public sector with guiding principles of data readiness and value controversy. © 2021 The Korean Association for Public Administration.</abstract>

      <abstract>Many governments around the world have launched their open government data (OGD) portal to improve the government’s transparency by sharing their data with the public such as National Covid-19 Immunization Programmed (NCIP), which has been published at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CITF-Malaysia&#x2F;citf-public. However, increasing the number of datasets, data types, volume and complexity will be raised the integration issues. There-fore, it is essential to evaluate and analyses those huge amounts of these datasets. NCIP provides multiple data sources and datasets. These may raise the Big Data (BD) issues and pose various evaluation and analysis problems to produce valuable information. To generate meaningful linked data to support the purposes of this research study, the relationship between these disparate datasets needs to be identified and construct a comprehensive framework. In order to understand the causes of OGD development of big data, this study involves a detailed examination and comparison of existing theories and actual approaches to handle public sector open data concerns. According to the review, the framework was dominantly adopted over architecture, infrastructures, theoretical and conceptual framework in previous research to examine the revolution of government public accessible data. According to the findings, most existing frameworks do not con-sider the demand for public open data in health such as NCPI. Previous re-search on OGD for health has a lesser number of advanced BD frameworks. In the public sector, there is still a lack of investment and use of Big Data. The findings will aid academics in doing empirical research on the revealed need, as well as offer decision-makers with a better understanding of how to leverage OGD adoption in health by taking relevant actions. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.</abstract>

      <abstract>Aim&#x2F;Purpose The main goal of this systematic literature review was to look for studies that provide information relevant to business intelligence’s (BI) framework development and implementation in the tourism sector. This paper tries to classify the tourism sectors where BI is implemented, group various BI functionalities, and identify common problems encountered by previous research. Background There has been an increased need for BI implementation to support decision-making in the tourism sector. Tourism stakeholders such as management of destination, accommodation, transportation, and public administration need a guideline to understand functional requirements before implementation. This paper addresses the problem by comprehensively reviewing the functionalities and issues that need to be considered based on previous business intelligence framework development and implementation in tourism sectors. Methodology We have conducted a systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Guidelines for Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method. The search is conducted using online academic database platforms, resulting in 543 initial articles published from 2002 to 2022. Contribution The paper could be of interest to relevant stakeholders in the tourism industry because it provides an overview of the capabilities and limitations of business intelligence for tourism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify and classify the BI functionalities needed for tourism sectors and implementation issues related to organizations, people, and technologies that need to be considered. Findings BI functionalities identified in this study include basic functions such as data analysis, reports, dashboards, data visualization, performance metrics, and key performance indicator, and advanced functions such as predictive analytics, trend indicators, strategic planning tools, profitability analysis, benchmarking, budgeting, and forecasting. When implementing BI, the issues that need to be considered include organizational, people and process, and technological issues. Recommendations As data is a major issue in BI implementation, tourism stakeholders, especially for Practitioners in developing countries, may need to build a tourism data center or centralized coordination regulated by the government. They can implement basic functions first before implementing more advanced features later. Recommendations We recommend further studying the BI implementation barriers by employing a for Researchers perspective of an adoption framework such as the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework. Impact on Society This research has a potential impact on improving the tourism industry’s performance by providing insight to stakeholders about what is needed to help them make more accurate decisions using business intelligence. Future Research Future research may involve collaboration between practitioners and academics in developing various BI architectures specific to each tourism industry, such as destination management, hospitality, or transportation. © 2022 Informing Science Institute.

      <abstract>Traditional centralized water-management systems have tended to fall short in delivering environmental and amenity benefits in urban areas. Water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) projects have been proposed as an alternative due to their ability to generate multiple benefits, including improving water quality, water supply, aesthetics, urban cooling, spaces for recreation, and habitat for biodiversity. However, in most cities, investment in such systems has been relatively low, in part due to the difficulty of monetizing the multifunctional benefits of WSUD projects and including them in comprehensive economic analyses. We describe the development, testing and application of INFFEWS (Investment Framework For the Economics of Water Sensitive cities), an economic decision-support system for investment in WSUD projects. INFFEWS is based on a Benefit: Cost Analysis (BCA) framework and is consistent with standard BCA. A prominent feature of the framework is its strong emphasis on quantifying the monetary-equivalent values of intangible (non-market) benefits from WSUD projects. Development of the tools and their supporting materials has involved extensive consultation with intended users, review of existing tools, and primary research over eight years (2013–2020). The frameworks can be applied to business-case development and decision making at multiple levels in public-sector and private-sector organisations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>

      <abstract>The governance of public sector organizations has been challenged by the
growing adoption and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and
algorithms. Algorithmic transparency, conceptualized here using the
dimensions of accessibility and explainability, fosters the appraisal of
algorithms&#39; footprint in decisions of public agencies, and should
include impacts on civil servants&#39; work. However, although discretion
will not disappear, AI innovations might have a negative impact on how
public employees support their decisions. This article is intended to
answer the following research questions: RQ1. To what extent algorithms
affect discretionary power of civil servants to make decisions? RQ2. How
algorithmic transparency can impact discretionary power of civil
servants? To do so, we analyze SALER, a case based on a set of
algorithms focused on the prevention of irregularities in the Valencian
regional administration (GVA), Spain, using a qualitative methodology
supported on semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis. Among
the results of the study, our empirical work suggests the existence of a
series of factors that might be linked to the positive impacts of
algorithms on the work and discretionary power of civil servants. Also,
we identify different pathways for achieving algorithmic transparency,
such as the involvement of civil servants in active development, or
auditing processes being recognized by law, among others.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) policies and strategies have been designed
and adopted in the public sector during the last few years, with Chief
Information Officers (CIOs) playing a key role. Using socio-cognitive
and institutional approaches on Information Technologies (ITs) in
(public) organizations, we consider that the assumptions, expectations,
and knowledge (technological frames) of those in charge (CIOs) of
designing AI strategies are guiding the future of these emerging systems
in the public sector. In this study, we focus on the technological
frames of CIOs in the largest Spanish local governments. Based on a
survey administered to CIOs leading IT departments, this article
presents original data about their technological frames on AI. Our
results: (1) provide insights about how CIOs tend to focus on the
technological features of AI implementation while often overlook some of
the social, political, and ethical challenges in the public sector; (2)
expand the theory on AI by enabling the construction of propositions and
testable hypotheses for future research in the field. Therefore, the
comparative study of technological frames will be key to successfully
design and implement AI policies and strategies in the public sector and
to tackle future challenges and opportunities.</abstract>

      <abstract>In its effort to modernize its public service delivery, Malaysia is actively leveraging on big data analytics. To support this ambitious initiative, a new framework addressing the needs of Big Data Quality for Malaysia is imperative, as big data analytics requires high quality data in order for it to be useful. Unfortunately, a proper big data quality framework, particularly one which focuses on the specific context and needs of Malaysia&#39;s Public Sector Open Data initiative is missing. This paper thus focuses on the proposed development of the Big Data Quality Framework for Malaysia&#39;s Public Sector Open Data Initiative (MyPS-ODI). Using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach, we conceptualize and propose a framework for big data quality that can contribute in enabling the sharing of quality data widely, so as to increase the transparency of the Malaysian government&#39;s services, and provide people and the business community the opportunity to increase creativity and innovation in developing new products and services through high quality data. The proposed framework will benefit IS managers in government sectors and help them better understand and meet their consumers&#39; data quality needs, as well as help them to facilitate big data analytics readiness of the public sector in the country. It will also assist in providing a high-quality platform to the citizens to get quality information from official government sources. Finally, the framework will help in saving the time and effort needed in correcting the results of data analysis due to poor data quality, by providing quality data from the data preparation stage. © Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology.</abstract>

      <abstract>Business Process Management is a domain that is composed by different research or application areas. Process Mining is one of them and it is a data-driven approach to analyze and improve processes. In Process Mining &#39;next activity prediction&#39; is one of the most important task. The used data are event logs i.e., a timeseries of recorded events. The event logs are mainly processed using deep learning algorithms. In this study, it was proposed the comparison of prediction performance of shallow learning algorithms with a three block Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) architecture in predicting the next activity. The algorithms were applied on all the events logs of the BPI Challenge 2020 dataset. Results show that shallow learning algorithms outperform the three-block architecture from a minimum of 1.5 to a maximum of 6 times. This suggest that simpler algorithms may be more effective than the three-block architecture. © 2023 The Authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public administration scholars have so far largely viewed big data as a
kind of technocratic transformation. However, through citizens&#39; digital
records, use of service apps, social media, digital sensors, and other
digital footprints, big data also gives policymakers insights into
citizen choices and is therefore potentially supportive of public values
such as participation and openness. Focusing on two underexplored
countries, Germany and the Netherlands, this article develops a public
values framework for big data that considers citizen values alongside
technocratic ones. It takes the particular case of public information
agencies such as ombudsmen and courts of audit, examining the functions
they play and whether they have the capacity to address tensions arising
between technocratic and citizen values. The study finds that, while
capacity does exist, it is heavily tilted toward technocratic values,
with no capacity to address participative values. Finally, five
propositions are advanced, which describe where the tensions lie and
therefore where the attention of public information agencies should best
be focused.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big data applications have been acclaimed as potentially transformative
for the public sector. But, despite this acclaim, most theory of big
data is narrowly focused around technocratic goals. The conceptual
frameworks that situate big data within democratic governance systems
recognizing the role of citizens are still missing. This paper explores
the democratic governance impacts of big data in three policy areas
using Robert Dahl&#39;s dimensions of control and autonomy. Key impacts and
potential tensions are highlighted. There is evidence of impacts on both
dimensions, but the dimensions conflict as well as align in notable ways
and focused policy efforts will be needed to find a balance.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework of how knowledge management (KM) systems can facilitate the incorporation of big data into strategic decisions. Advanced analytics are becoming increasingly critical in making strategic decisions in any organization from the private to public sectors and from for-profit companies to not-for-profit organizations. Despite the growing importance of capturing, sharing and implementing people’s knowledge in organizations, it is still unclear how big data and the need for advanced analytics can inform and, if necessary, reform the design and implementation of KM systems. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: To address this gap, a combined approach has been applied. The KM and data analysis systems implemented by companies were analyzed, and the analysis was complemented by a review of the extant literature. Findings: Four types of data-based decisions and a set of ground rules are identified toward enabling KM systems to handle big data and advanced analytics. Practical implications: The paper proposes a practical framework that takes into account the diverse combinations of data-based decisions. Suggestions are provided about how KM systems can be reformed to facilitate the incorporation of big data and advanced analytics into organizations’ strategic decision-making. Originality&#x2F;value: This is the first typology of data-based decision-making considering advanced analytics. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>Due to the rapid development of Internet technologies and social media,
sentiment analysis has become an important opinion mining technique.
Recent research work has described the effectiveness of different
sentiment classification techniques ranging from simple rule-based and
lexicon-based approaches to more complex machine learning algorithms.
While lexicon-based approaches have suffered from the lack of
dictionaries and labeled data, machine learning approaches have fallen
short in terms of accuracy. This paper proposes an integrated framework
which bridges the gap between lexicon-based and machine learning
approaches to achieve better accuracy and scalability. To solve the
scalability issue that arises as the feature-set grows, a novel genetic
algorithm (GA)-based feature reduction technique is proposed. By using
this hybrid approach, we are able to reduce the feature-set size by up
to 42% without compromising the accuracy. The comparison of our feature
reduction technique with more widely used principal component analysis
(PCA) and latent semantic analysis (LSA) based feature reduction
techniques have shown up to 15.4% increased accuracy over PCA and up to
40.2% increased accuracy over LSA. Furthermore, we also evaluate our
sentiment analysis framework on other metrics including precision,
recall, F-measure, and feature size. In order to demonstrate the
efficacy of GA-based designs, we also propose a novel cross-disciplinary
area of geopolitics as a case study application for our sentiment
analysis framework. The experiment results have shown to accurately
measure public sentiments and views regarding various topics such as
terrorism, global conflicts, and social issues. We envisage the
applicability of our proposed work in various areas including security
and surveillance, law-and-order, and public administration.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose With the development of information technology (IT), governments
around the globe are using state-of-the-art IT interfaces to implement
the so-called 3E&#39;s in public service delivery, that is, economy,
efficiency and effectiveness. Two of these IT interfaces relate to
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT). While AI
focuses on providing a &#x60;&#x60;human&#39;&#39; garb for computing devices, thereby
making them &#x60;&#x60;intelligent&#39;&#39; devices, IoT relies on interfaces between
sensors and the environment to make &#x60;&#x60;intelligent&#39;&#39; decisions.
Recently, the convergence of AI and IoT - also referred to as Artificial
Intelligence of Things (AIoT) - is seen as a real opportunity to
refurbish the public service delivery formats. However, there is limited
understanding as to how AIoT could contribute to the improvisation of
public service delivery. This study aims to create a modular framework
for AIoT in addition to highlighting the drivers and barriers for its
integration in the public sector. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach This
descriptive-explanatory study takes a qualitative approach. It entails a
thorough examination of the drivers and barriers of integrating AI and
IoT in the public sector. A review of literature has led to the
development of a conceptual framework outlining the various factors that
contribute to creating public value. Findings Value creation occurs when
AI and IoT coalesce in the public service delivery mechanisms.
Originality&#x2F;value AIoT is a cutting-edge technology revolutionizing
health care, agriculture, infrastructure and all other industrial
domains. This study adds to the growing body of knowledge on the public
sector&#39;s use of AI and IoT. Understanding these disruptive technologies
is critical to formulating policies and regulations that can maximize
the potential benefits for the public-sector organizations.</abstract>

      <abstract>This research investigates the role of public sector innovation
outcomes, e.g. trademark innovation, information and communication
technology (ICT), renewable energy, and governance, in the sustainable
development of Bangladesh during 1980-2019. Utilising the dynamic
autoregressive distributed lag (DARDL) simulation approach, this study
divulges a favourable long-term influencing profile of public sector
innovation outcomes, i.e. trademark innovation, ICT, and renewable
energy on sustainable development, while governance has a heterogeneous
impact. Besides, the findings from the DARDL simulations area plots
display 10% counterfactual shocks to the public sector innovation
outcomes on sustainable development. Furthermore, the Kernel-based
regularised least square machine learning algorithm approach used in the
study examines the marginal effects of the public sector innovation
outcomes on sustainable development for robust findings. Therefore, the
policy suggestions are solely concerned with the public sector&#39;s
adoption of more innovation dynamics through appropriate policy
formulation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies are increasingly being integrated into public sector programs to help with decision-support and effective distribution of constrained resources. The field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has begun to examine how the resultant sociotechnical systems may be designed appropriately when targeting underserved populations. We present an ethnographic study of a large-scale real-world integration of an AI system for resource allocation in a call-based maternal and child health program in India. Our findings uncover complexities around determining who benefits from the intervention, how the human-AI collaboration is managed, when intervention must take place in alignment with various priorities, and why the AI is sought, for what purpose. Our paper offers takeaways for human-centered AI integration in public health, drawing attention to the work done by the AI as actor, the work of configuring the human-AI partnership with multiple diverse stakeholders, and the work of aligning program goals for design and implementation through continual dialogue across stakeholders.  © 2023 Owner&#x2F;Author.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public administration has become the main force for society as well as the government. Given the relevance and urgency of public administration research, this research aims to present publications on public administration research from the Scopus database using bibliometric analysis. The method of this research is qualitative methods using Publish or Perish by Harzing for citations in the form of metrics, Microsoft Excel for frequency analysis, and VOS viewer for data visualization with period time 2010–2021. Based on the research results, the publications on public administration research have been consistently increasing since 2015 with 656 citations. The most popular keywords identified in the document set are development, drug administration, food and practice, China, impact, public administration review and state, application, public administration research, big data, future, case, evolution, and efficiency. The relevance of public administration research probably lies in striking the right balance between application and theory development. On the one hand, public administration research should expose researchers to real-life managerial challenges and give them the necessary tools to implement policy successfully. On the other hand, it should also expose public administration researchers to critical thinking and empower them to engage in governance and societal challenges, propose theoretical solutions and build new theories. © 2023 The Authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The objective of the article is to develop and test in practice a mechanism for constructing AI&#x2F;ML-based predic-tions, adapted for use in the system of government socio-economic administration in Ukraine. Research design is repre-sented by several methods like qualitative analysis in order to identify potential benefits of AI use in different spheres of government administration, synthesis to generate new datasets for the experiment, and abstraction to abstract from the current situation in Ukraine, population displacement, uneven statistics reporting. Among empirical methods are prediction and experimental methods to construct a mechanism for the implementation of AI&#x2F;ML prediction methods in public administration, develop a high-level architecture of the AI&#x2F;ML prediction system, and create and train the COVID-19 prediction neuron network. A holistic vision of the AI&#x2F;ML-based prediction construction mechanism, depending on data taken from state official online platforms, is presented, in addition, the ways of its possible practical application for the improvement of the national system of state socio-economic administration are described. The main condition and guarantee of obtaining accurate results is access to quality data through platforms such as Diia, HELSI, national education platforms, government banks, etc. The findings of the research suggest that wide implementation of AI&#x2F;ML-based prediction technologies will allow the government in perspective to increase the efficiency of the use of budgetary resources, the effectiveness of the government target programs, improve the quality of public administration and to better satisfy the citizens’ demand. Future studies should be done to overcome the limitations of the approach: find a way to protect and extract sensitive information from government platforms, fight neural network bias, and create a more perfect system that is able to make multiparameter predictions and is also self-improving on the basis of the obtained results. © 2023 The Author(s).

      <abstract>Introduction: In 2008, the French National Authority for Health (HAS)recommended that “conservative” treatments be adopted for meniscal lesions. This recommendation and the lack of superiority of meniscectomy over non-operative treatment for meniscus degeneration have modified the treatment pathway. However, the impact of these findings on French clinical practice is not known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the change over time in the number of alternative surgical procedures (meniscectomy and meniscus repair)and regional variation in France using data from the French agency for information on hospital care (ATIH). Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the number of meniscectomy procedures will decrease, and the number of repair procedures will increase over time at various healthcare facilities. Patients and methods: Between 2005 and 2017, the number of hospitalizations in the Medicine-Surgery-Obstetrics wards for meniscectomy (NFFC003 and NFCC004)or meniscus repair (NFEC001 and NFEC002)was evaluated overall and then based on whether the stay occurred in public or private sector hospitals in France. Data were extracted from the ATIH database and the findings were (1)related to French demographics during the period in question; (2)separated into public or private sector hospitals; (3)distributed into various regions in France and; (4)stratified by patient age. Results: Between 2005 and 2017, 1,564,461 meniscectomy and 63,142 meniscus repair procedures were done in France. Over this period in the entire country, the meniscectomy rate gradually decreased from 19.80&#x2F;10,000 inhabitants in 2005 to 15.77&#x2F;10,000 inhabitants in 2017 (21.4% reduction)(p &lt; 0.0001)while the meniscus repair rate increased from 0.42&#x2F;10,000 inhabitants in 2005 to 1.36&#x2F;10,000 inhabitants in 2017 (320% increase)(p &lt; 0.0001). The largest meniscectomy reduction effort occurred in private sector hospitals, going from 15.79 to 12.01&#x2F;10,000 inhabitants in 12 years; the decrease was smaller in public hospitals (going from 4.01 to 3.77&#x2F;10,000 inhabitants)(p &lt; 0.0001 in both cases). The change in the procedure ratio between private and public hospitals was asymmetric, with the meniscus repair&#x2F;meniscectomy ratio clearly increasing more in public hospitals (4% to 12.6%)between 2005 and 2017 than in private hospitals (1.6% to 6.6%)(p &lt; 0.0001). We found large regional differences: regions in Eastern France had higher meniscectomy rates, while regions in Western France had higher meniscus repair rates. When the analysis of procedures between 2008 and 2017 was stratified by age, a similar increase in repair procedures was found in all age brackets. Conversely, the reduction in meniscectomy was most apparent before 40 years of age, and the number of meniscectomy procedures was stable after 60 years of age. Conclusion: These findings suggest there has been a significant shift in the surgical management of meniscal injuries towards more conservative treatments. But the large variations between regions in France is evidence of a continued disparity in clinical practices. Level of evidence: IV, retrospective study without control group. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS</abstract>

      <abstract>Effective contractor selection is crucial for successful execution of construction projects. In contrast to the conventional lowest-bid approach prevalent in the public sector, this study focuses on developing a framework that minimizes time and cost overruns by considering diverse criteria for contractor selection. A variety of machine learning models, including multi-linear regression, random forest, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network, have been employed, with multi-linear regression proving to be the most effective, achieving the lowest Mean Squared Error of 0.00003366. To determine the final order allocation, a multi-objective mathematical model was utilized to optimize conflicting criteria, such as time and cost overruns, sustainability, risk, and safety aspects related to shortlisted contractors. The findings highlight the significance of specific selection criteria, such as turnover, experience in similar projects, qualification of staff, technology utilization, client satisfaction, accident records, available bid capacity, and socioeconomic factors. This study emphasizes a three-phase decision-making framework for contractor selection and order allocation, particularly in public construction projects, with a focus on sustainability. By adopting this approach, government agencies can enhance infrastructure projects and minimize overruns through optimization and analytical tools, which aligns with the Gati-Shakti scheme of the Indian government. It is recommended that clients embrace a holistic approach to contractor selection, considering both technical and non-technical factors, to ensure successful project outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</abstract>

      <abstract>The development of information technology and its use in everyday life must inevitably have an impact on public administration and its decision-making. Progress in artificial intelligence is also opening up wider opportunities for the use of automation of decision-making processes in public administration. Decision-making processes that once had to be handled by humans can now be automated. However, there must be a sufficient legal basis for this, setting out the legal limits of such automated decision-making. In this paper, the legal possibilities of automation of decision-making processes in the field of public administration in the Slovak Republic were examined, the obstacles that hinder the use of this tool were defined, as well as certain legal solutions eliminating or minimizing the consequences of these obstacles were outlined. The purpose of this paper was not to exhaustively describe and solve the problems with the automation of decision-making processes in public administration in the Slovak Republic. Rather, the purpose was to outline the problem areas that should be addressed in legal research in the coming period.  © 2024 The Author.</abstract>

      <abstract>In recent years, a discourse of &#x60;ethical artificial intelligence&#39; has
emerged and gained international traction in response to widely
publicised AI failures. In Australia, the discourse around ethical AI
does not accord with the reality of AI deployment in the public sector.
Drawing on institutional ethnographic approaches, this paper describes
the misalignments between how technology is described in government
documentation, and how it is deployed in social service delivery. We
argue that the propagation of ethical principles legitimates established
new public management strategies, and pre-empts questions regarding the
efficacy of AI development; instead positioning implementation as
inevitable and, provided an ethical framework is adopted, laudable. The
ethical AI discourse acknowledges, and ostensibly seeks to move past,
widely reported administrative failures involving new technologies. In
actuality, this discourse works to make AI implementation a reality,
ethical or not.</abstract>

      <abstract>The aim of this study is to analyse the factors affecting the overall happiness level of Korean residents using neural network analysis, and to identify the resultant theoretical and policy implications. The analysis data for this study consist of survey data collected in 2020 by the Community Well-Being Research Center at Seoul National University Graduate School of Public Administration in Korea; the number of respondents was 16,555. The study employed the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) method, one of the neural network analysis methods. It was found that the most important factor affecting the happiness of Korean residents was their own level of awareness of their social status. The next important was satisfaction with the level of infrastructure relating to their local living environment, the third most important being their level of awareness of their own income level. The study strongly suggests that awareness of the social status of local residents should be reflected in future happiness research and the establishment of happiness-related policies. It also suggests the need to apply new research methods, including neural network analysis, given that big data analysis has proven insufficient in happiness research. In the future, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence, the use of big data analysis methods will become more desirable in providing programmes for improving happiness levels tailored to individual situations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.</abstract>

      <abstract>The aim of this study is to derive the important factors that influence levels of happiness in Korea, and to identify which factors are particularly important among these influencing factors. To achieve this goal, topic modelling analysis, machine learning analysis and neural network analysis methods were utilized. The Netminer 4.5 program was used for topic modelling analysis and machine learning analysis, and SPSS MODELER 18 was used to perform neural network analysis. Two types of analysis data were used in this study. The first consisted of 1 000 papers relating to happiness published in academic journals managed by the Springer publishing company, which were used to derive happiness-influencing factors. The second consisted of a survey conducted in 2020 by the Community Well-being Center of the Graduate School of Public Administration at Seoul National University in Korea. A total of 16 655 people responded to this survey. The analysis results of the study are as follows. Important variables that affect the level of happiness of Korean residents are: family life, social status, income, health, and perceptions of inequality. Analysis using neural network analysis of the most important factors influencing happiness showed that satisfaction with family life had the most important influence. This suggests that policies that can improve the quality of family life, such as family-friendly work environments, childcare support, and domestic violence prevention and response programmes, will become important in the future. © 2024, Editorial Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia.

      <abstract>A challenge in developing an ambient activity recognition system for use
in elder care is finding a balance between the sophistication of the
system and a cost structure that fits within the budgets of public and
private sector healthcare organisations. Much activity recognition
research in the context of elder care is based on dense networks of
sensors and advanced methods, such as supervised machine learning
algorithms. This paper presents the data processing aspects of an
activity recognition system based on a simpler, knowledge-based
unsupervised approach, designed for a sparse network of sensors. By
structuring sensor data management as a streaming system, we provide a
simple programming model for the application logic, which facilitates
building a fault-tolerant system with the potential for distributed data
management within the sensor network. The system, evaluated by a public
sector healthcare organisation, constitutes an example of a system that
is useful and has a sustainable cost structure.</abstract>

      <abstract>The public sector in Europe can make use of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost its digital transformation. To improve public services in alignment with the European democratic values, principles and rights, public procurement can leverage the innovation of AI for the public good. Both AI and the Internet of Things (IoT), fueled with quality data, offer new possibilities to spark the innovative power of a city, a Smart City. The potential of AI is at the tip of our mobile phones and the connection to networks where data is shared. This can be useful to citizens and administrations, but not without challenges and risks. Therefore, this article explores what a Smart City is, and the benefits and risks of AI based solutions in the context of Innovation Procurement. It offers examples and refers to legal and ethical frame-works for the reuse of data. © 2021, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>The abandonment of rural areas has become a major demographical challenge in recent years, especially in Spain and, more specifically, in the Valencian Community. A classification released by the government of this region revealed that almost a third of its municipalities are at depopulation risk. This classification is based on demographic variables, which are valid for identifying the phenomenon but insufficient to provide insight into how to counteract it. Instead, this study developed a methodology to model rural depopulation risk from land use and socioeconomic variables. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis enabled identifying which variables were meaningful for rural depopulation. Then, support vector classification was used to fit the demography-based depopulation classification used by the regional government. The mean accuracy reached was above 80%, which validated the proposed model and variables. Since crop areas was found to be one of the most influential variables in such model, the potential of agroeconomic measures to counter depopulation was examined. The results achieved suggested that depopulation might be reduced by 25% if exploiting 25% of the areas suitable for agriculture. In view of these outputs, public administrations may promote the implementation of land use spatial strategies based on sustainable agriculture. © 2023 The Authors</abstract>

      <abstract>South Korea introduced the artificial intelligence impact assessment and
was the first case of introducing the artificial intelligence impact
assessment as national-level legislation. Artificial intelligence impact
assessments will be helpful in deciding whether to introduce artificial
intelligence by comparing costs and benefits. However, South Korea&#39;s
approach had limitations. First, an impact assessment was introduced
only in the public sector. Second, artificial intelligence impact
assessments were voluntary. Third, the subject of artificial
intelligence impact assessments was limited to society. Fourth, it is
necessary to establish a relationship with other impact assessments.
Fifth, specific details were incomplete.</abstract>

      <abstract>As the digital transformation accelerates in our society, open data are
being increasingly recognized as a key resource for digital innovation
in the public sector. This study explores the following two research
questions: (1) Can a machine learning approach be appropriately used for
measuring and evaluating open data utilization? (2) Should different
machine learning models be applied for measuring open data utilization
depending on open data attributes (field and usage type)? This study
used single-model (random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and
multi-model (stacking ensemble) machine learning methods. A key finding
is that the best-performing models differed depending on open data
attributes (field and type of use). The applicability of the machine
learning approach for measuring and evaluating open data utilization in
advance was also confirmed. This study contributes to open data
utilization and to the application of its intrinsic value to society.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: In contrast to point forecasts, interval forecasts provide information on future variability. This research thus aimed to develop interval prediction models by addressing two significant issues: (1) a simple average with an additive property is commonly used to derive combined forecasts, but this unreasonably ignores the interaction among sequences used as sources of information, and (2) the time series often does not conform to any statistical assumptions. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: To develop an interval prediction model, the fuzzy integral was applied to nonlinearly combine forecasts generated by a set of grey prediction models, and a sequence including the combined forecasts was then used to construct a neural network. All required parameters relevant to the construction of an interval model were optimally determined by the genetic algorithm. Findings: The empirical results for tourism demand showed that the proposed non-additive interval model outperformed the other interval prediction models considered. Practical implications: The private and public sectors in economies with high tourism dependency can benefit from the proposed model by using the forecasts to help them formulate tourism strategies. Originality&#x2F;value: In light of the usefulness of combined point forecasts and interval model forecasting, this research contributed to the development of non-additive interval prediction models on the basis of combined forecasts generated by grey prediction models. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>With the advent of nonrelational databases, data science has gradually become the focus of attention in academia and engineering. The data generated by human social networking is also gradually increasing, and big data technology appears in this context. Its main purpose is to obtain key information from complex data sets and realize the role of comprehensive analysis. In recent years, the concept of the Internet of Everything has gradually entered all walks of life. Similar to the design of smart cities, smart communities, and smart buildings, IoT technology has also been adopted. The development of the market economy and the deepening of the reform of the economic system require that the government&#39;s public services must also be transformed as soon as possible. The responsibilities undertaken by the government are becoming more and more complex and important. The traditional government public management methods cannot meet the needs of all levels of society. The development of big data and the Internet of Things provides new opportunities for the government to innovate management methods, which is also one of the cores of future government work. The government needs to gradually transform the government&#39;s public management method based on big data and the Internet of Things platform, relying on information technology, so as to improve people&#39;s satisfaction and happiness index. Based on the problems existing in traditional public management, this paper focuses on the analysis of local government management methods and takes Shenyang City as the case analysis object to innovate local government public management methods and at the same time provides some reference for other regions to innovate public management methods.  © 2022 Wenfang Jin.</abstract>

      <abstract>In the past five years, private companies, research institutions and
public sector organizations have issued principles and guidelines for
ethical artificial intelligence (AI). However, despite an apparent
agreement that AI should be &#x60;ethical&#39;, there is debate about both what
constitutes &#x60;ethical AI&#39; and which ethical requirements, technical
standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To
investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging,
we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines
on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around
five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness,
non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive
divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they
are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and
how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of
integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical
analysis and adequate implementation strategies. As AI technology
develops rapidly, it is widely recognized that ethical guidelines are
required for safe and fair implementation in society. But is it possible
to agree on what is &#x60;ethical AI&#39;? A detailed analysis of 84 AI ethics
reports around the world, from national and international organizations,
companies and institutes, explores this question, finding a convergence
around core principles but substantial divergence on practical
implementation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Advances in big data and artificial intelligence (AI), including machine
learning (ML) and other cognitive computing technologies (CCT), have
facilitated the development of human resource management (HRM)
applications promising greater efficiency, economy, and effectiveness
for public administration (Maciejewski, 2017) and better alignment with
the modern, constantly evolving employment landscape. It is not
surprising then that these advanced technologies are featured in
proposals to elevate the government&#39;s human capital. This article
discusses current and emerging AI applications that stand to impact most
(if not all) HRM functions and their prospects for elevating public
human capital. In particular, this article (a) reviews the current state
of the field with regards to AI and HRM, (b) discusses AI&#39;s current and
potential impact upon the core functional areas of HRM, (c) identifies
the main challenges AI poses to such concerns as public values, equity,
and traditional merit system principles, and (d) concludes by
identifying research needs for public HRM scholarship and practice that
highlight the growing role and influence of AI applications in the
workplace.</abstract>

      <abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of social media platforms as crucial channels for the dissemination of information and public opinion. Comprehending the sentiment conveyed in tweets on COVID-19 is of paramount importance for individuals involved in policymaking, crisis management, and public health administration. This study seeks to conduct a comprehensive review of the current BERT and deep CNN models utilized in sentiment analysis of COVID-19 tweets. Additionally, the study aims to propose potential future research directions for the development of a BERT model that is both lightweight and high quality. The BERT model acquires contextual representations of words and effectively captures the intricate semantics of tweets related to COVID-19, whereas the deep CNN captures the hierarchical organization of the tweet embeddings. The performance of the model is exceptional, exceeding the current sentiment analysis methods for tweets related to COVID-19. Our study involves a comprehensive analysis of vast COVID-19 tweet datasets, wherein we establish the efficacy of the BERT-deep CNN models in precisely categorizing the sentiment of COVID-19 tweets in real time. The outcomes of the research offer significant perspectives on the public&#39;s attitudes, supporting decision-makers in comprehending the general viewpoint, detecting disinformation, and guiding emergency response tactics. Additionally, this study serves to enhance the progress of sentiment analysis methodologies within the realm of public health emergencies and establishes a standard for forthcoming investigations in the sentiment analysis of social media data pertaining to COVID-19. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>The ongoing internationalisation of economies more and more intensely influences the activity of the education and science sector—consequently, the pressure to achieve the institutional and individual goals increases. Given these circumstances, the authors of this article decided to identify the relations between the type and scope of motivation used at universities and the evaluation results of their study and scientific activity. The study was carried out on Polish universities among a representative study sample of 1303 academics. For the analysis of the results, correlation analysis, regression models and data mining techniques were used. The research results indicated connections between the level of the study being carried out with such motivators as working in conditions of high innovativeness, wide access to publications and infrastructure, allowing for commercialisation of the study results. The increase in the quality level of the study is also fostered by the support and help of direct supervisors. What is demotivating is the periodic qualitative assessment and unproductive relations with the environment. The study results filled the gaps in the knowledge on the relations between the motivation and the evaluation of the university and between the range and type of motivators used in higher education. © 2021 The Authors</abstract>

      <abstract>Decision support systems, which incorporate artificial intelligence and
big data, are receiving significant attention in the public sector.
Decision support systems are sociocultural artefacts that are subject to
a mix of technical and political choices, and critical investigation of
these choices and the rationales they reflect are paramount since they
are inscribed into and may cause harm, violate fundamental rights and
reproduce negative social patterns. Applying and merging the concepts of
sense-making and translation, this article investigates the rationales,
translations and critical reflections that shape the development of a
decision support system to support social workers assessing referrals
concerning child neglect. It presents findings from a qualitative case
study conducted in 2019-2020 at the Citizen Centre Children and Young
People, Copenhagen Municipality, Denmark. The analysis shows how key
actors through processes of translation construct, negotiate and
readjust problem definitions, roles, interests, responsibilities and
ideas of ambiguity and accountability. Although technological
solutionism is present in these processes, it is not the only rationale
invested. Rather, technological and data-driven rationales are adjusted
to and merged with rationales of efficiency, return on investment and
child welfare. Through continuous renegotiation of roles,
responsibilities and problems according to these rationales, the key
actors attempt to orchestrate ways of managing the complexity facing
child welfare services by projecting images of future potentials of the
decision support system that are yet to be realised.</abstract>

      <abstract>Tourism demand forecasting is essential for forward tourism planning. To develop appropriate public policies and ensure sound business investment decisions, both government administrations and private sector businesses use basic tourist demand forecasting to plan future operations and assess the need for facilities and infrastructure investment. Therefore, forecasting has become indispensable to tourism management. This study proposes a combined tourism forecasting model using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a clustering algorithm, which considers two aspects of the given data series: sequence patterns and near characteristics, which embody structural changes and time series correlations. Training data were clustered into homogenous groups, and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster was employed. Several neighboring samples were then selected to capture the current changes in the data series trends. Finally, the two prediction results derived from the sequence patterns and near characteristics were combined to determine the final forecast results. To verify the superiority and accuracy of the proposed model, it was compared with three other ANN-based models and the most popular ARIMA model using three non-linear, non-stationary tourist arrivals data series. Experimental cases studies demonstrated that the proposed combination method consistently outperformed the other related methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>The main purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date understanding of the utilization and deployment of emerging technologies in the public sector, as this is reflected through 19 recently funded Horizon 2020 research projects. For the needs of this study, we have adopted a well-known literature review method that enables a concept-centric analysis of the accumulated knowledge in the field under consideration, and accordingly proposed a conceptual framework that facilitates such an analysis. Through a detailed consideration of these projects and their pilot case implementations, a series of insights about recent research development and applications in the public sector are extracted and discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to gain such insights from a research projects perspective, which may reveal useful information about the utilization and deployment of these technologies in real-life pilots. The findings of this study are also justified or challenged by referring to recent review articles that investigate the use of emerging technologies in the public sector. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner&#x2F;author(s).

      <abstract>Visual analytics (VA) tools support data exploration by helping analysts quickly and iteratively generate views of data which reveal interesting patterns. However, these tools seldom enable explicit checks of the resulting interpretations of data - e.g., whether patterns can be accounted for by a model that implies a particular structure in the relationships between variables. We present EVM, a data exploration tool that enables users to express and check provisional interpretations of data in the form of statistical models. EVM integrates support for visualization-based model checks by rendering distributions of model predictions alongside user-generated views of data. In a user study with data scientists practicing in the private and public sector, we evaluate how model checks influence analysts&#39; thinking during data exploration. Our analysis characterizes how participants use model checks to scrutinize expectations about data generating process and surfaces further opportunities to scaffold model exploration in VA tools. © 1995-2012 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Regardless of the nature, size, or business sector, organizations are now collecting burgeoning various volumes of data in different formats. As much as voluminous data are necessary for organizations to draw good insights needed for making informed decisions, traditional architectures and existing infrastructures are limited in delivering fast analytical processing needed for these Big Data. For success organizations need to apply technologies and methods that could empower them to cost effectively analyze these Big Data. However, many organizations in developing countries are constrained with limited access to technology, finances, infrastructure and skilled manpower. Yet, for productive use of these technologies and methods needed for Big Data analytics, both the organizations and their workforce need to be prepared. The major objective for this study was to investigate developing countries organizations&#39; readiness for Big Data analytics. Data for the study were collected from a public sector in South Africa and analyzed quantitatively. Results indicated that scalability, ICT infrastructure, top management support, organization size, financial resources, culture, employees&#39; e-skills, organization&#39;s customers&#39; and vendors are significant factors for organizations&#39; readiness for Big Data analytics. Likewise strategies, security and competitive pressure were found not to be significant. This study contributes to the scanty literature of Big Data analytics by providing empirical evidence of the factors that need attention when organizations are preparing for Big Data analytics. © 2017 Billy M.

      <abstract>The purpose of the study is to justify the use of the invariance property of the index method to study the change in the structure of tax revenues of Russian regions in the period from 2017 to 2021. The object of the study is eighty-five regions of the Russian Federation, and the subject is their financial and economic activities. Data from Rosstat and the Russian Federation’s FTS were used for the analysis. To date, the index method is actively used in the conduct of economic analysis at the macro- and meso-levels. The novelty of the study is that only the authors of the article on the basis of indices monitor the state of activity of the regions of the country, based on their tax revenues. The quantitative analysis is implemented using the statistical processing and data visualization functions of the R programming language. The intersubjective comparison was done to identify areas that require financial and economic transformation to improve the activities of the country’s regions. The comparison is made not only for one time, but also in dynamics. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the proposed tax income effectiveness index is an invariant indicator, independent of time and changes in the amount of tax income. It follows from the stationarity of the considered feature that the index values for 2017–2021 can be combined into a single homogeneous statistical aggregate. It was concluded that the index of effectiveness could be used as a grouping feature for the classification of Federation entities. The methodology developed can allow to intensify the socio-economic growth of the regions, indicating points requiring changes. In this regard, the results of the analysis can be useful to: the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation and the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation for the development of financial and tax policy; the Ministry of Economic Development and administrations of the subjects of the Russian Federation, indicating the economic zones of regions that need to be improved; to representatives of the business community when conducting economic analysis of regions. © Kamaletdinov А.

      <abstract>In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly
utilised in disaster management activities. The public is engaged with
AI in various ways in these activities. For instance, crowdsourcing
applications developed for disaster management to handle the tasks of
collecting data through social media platforms, and increasing disaster
awareness through serious gaming applications. Nonetheless, there are
limited empirical investigations and understanding on public perceptions
concerning AI for disaster management. Bridging this knowledge gap is
the justification for this paper. The methodological approach adopted
involved: Initially, collecting data through an online survey from
residents (n &#x3D; 605) of three major Australian cities; Then, analysis of
the data using statistical modelling. The analysis results revealed
that: (a) Younger generations have a greater appreciation of
opportunities created by AI-driven applications for disaster management;
(b) People with tertiary education have a greater understanding of the
benefits of AI in managing the pre- and post-disaster phases, and; (c)
Public sector administrative and safety workers, who play a vital role
in managing disasters, place a greater value on the contributions by AI
in disaster management. The study advocates relevant authorities to
consider public perceptions in their efforts in integrating AI in
disaster management.</abstract>

      <abstract>Open Government Data (OGD), including statistical data, such as
economic, environmental and social indicators, are data published by the
public sector for free reuse. These data have a huge potential when
exploited using Machine Learning methods. Linked Data technologies
facilitate retrieving integrated statistical indicators by defining and
executing SPARQL queries. However, statistical indicators are available
in different temporal and spatial granularity levels as well using
different units of measurement. This data article describes the
integrated statistical indicators that were retrieved from the official
Scottish data portal in order to facilitate the exploitation of Machine
Learning methods in OGD. Multiple SPARQL queries as well as manual
search in the data portal were employed towards this end. The resulted
dataset comprises the maximum number of compatible datasets, i.e.,
datasets with matching temporal and spatial characteristics. In
particular, the data include 60 statistical indicators from seven
categories such as health and social care, housing, and crime and
justice. The indicators refer to the 6,976 &#x60;&#x60;2011 data zones&#39;&#39; of
Scotland, while the year of reference is 2015. Data are ready to be used
by the research community, students, policy makers, and journalists and
give rise to plenty of social, business, and research scenarios that can
be solved using Machine Learning technologies and methods. (c) 2022 The

      <abstract>Blockchain technology is currently one of the trends considered to have a tremendous future ahead. It ensures data security, data sharing protection and automation development—elements that are of colossal importance in the era of cloud solutions, big data and Internet of Things (IoT) reality. Additionally, blockchain technology allows one to create new programmable ecosystems on an unprecedented scale. The implementation of blockchain technology leads not only to improving the flow of documents and data storage, as is the case with the creation of shared service centers (SSCs), but—as this paper shows—allows one to reduce the carbon footprint when servicing SSCs at a considerably higher organizational level at the same time. The example of an SSC in Elblag, ˛ Poland, proves that cloud solutions enabling electronic documents flow and data storage combined with blockchain technology are tools essential for further SSCs development. Furthermore, such tools allow us not only to obtain economic effects (i.e., cost reduction), but also to achieve positive ecological effects (i.e., carbon footprint reduction). © 2021 by the authors.

      <abstract>The article considers the modern development of public administration in
its connection with the use of digital technologies in order to increase
the effectiveness of the activities of government bodies, their focus on
the needs of the population, expand the possibility of implementing the
social functions of the state, openness of decision -making processes
and civil control of management activities. It is shown that on the
basis of digitalization and, in particular, application of artificial
intelligence solutions, the content of public administration, individual
procedures and stages of the management cycle, as well as state
functions are changing. The best practices of using artificial
intelligence in digital public administration systems of various
countries are considered, the possibilities of using smart solutions in
systems of sustainable development of territories, in analytics and
intergovernmental transfers within the framework of regional development
are described.</abstract>

      <abstract>A united front from all the stakeholders including public,
administration and academia alike is required to counter the growing
threat of climate change. The recent rise of social media as the new
public address system, makes it an ideal source of information to assess
public discussions and responses in real time. We mine c.1.7 m posts
from 55 climate related subreddits on social media platform Reddit since
its inception. Using USE, a state-of-the-art sentence encoder, and
K-means clustering algorithm, we develop a machine learning based
approach to identify, store, process and classify the posts
automatically, and at a scale. In the broad and multifaceted theme of
climate change, our approach narrows down the focus to 10 critical
underlying themes comprising the public discussions on social media over
time. Furthermore, we employ a full order partial correlation analysis
to assess the relationship between the different identified themes. We
show that in line with Paris Agreement, while the climate science
community has been successful in influencing the discussions on both the
causes and effects of climate change, the public administration has
failed to appropriately communicate the causes of climate change and has
been able to influence only the discussions on the effects of it. Hence,
our study shows a clear gap in the public communication by the
administration, wherein counter-intuitively less emphasis has been given
on the drivers of climate change. This information can be particularly
beneficial to policymakers and climate activists in decision making as
they try to close the gap between public and academia.</abstract>

      <abstract>In a sense, the 2008 financial crisis was a crisis of theory.
Regulators, banks, and financial markets all had encompassing
theoretical models about how the economy worked, but they all failed to
predict the looming crisis. As such, regulators increasingly turn to big
data to understand banks&#39; health. Despite the prominence of big data in
society, its use in the public sector remains grossly understudied. This
paper explores the regulatory use of big data in the case of the EU-wide
banking stress test, a key regulatory indicator. The paper draws on
interviews with supervisors at the European Central Bank (ECB), European
Banking Authority (EBA) and National Bank of Belgium (NBB), as well as
with consultants and risk directors in Belgian banks, to explain how big
data-driven regulation affects the relationship between regulators and
regulated entities. It draws particular attention to the epistemological
component of using large data sets in decision-making: a big data state
of mind. The article more specifically shows how the underlying
epistemology, rather than simply the bigness of datasets, affects the
relationship between regulators and regulated entities, and the
regulatory process at large. The paper concludes that regulators&#39; big
data state of mind calls for new practical and legal guidelines
regarding the validity of data-driven knowledge claims. Moreover, it
shows how accountability based on descriptive transparency no longer
makes sense in the &#x60;age of the algorithm&#39;, suggesting a shift towards
relational transparency and joint knowledge production.</abstract>

      <abstract>The users, sensors and networks of the Internet of Things generate huge amounts of data. Given the sophisticated (artificially intelligent) algorithms, computing power and software available, we would expect governments to have successfully completed their digital transformation into Jane Fountain&#39;s (2001) ‘Virtual State’. In practice, despite heavy investments, governments often fail to enact new digital technologies in an efficient, appropriate or fair way. This article provides an overview of techno-rational and socio-political failures and solutions at the macro-, meso- and micro-level to support digital transformation. The reviewed articles suggest a modest approach to digital transformation, with an emphasis on high-quality in-house IT infrastructure and expertise, but also better collaborative networks and strong leadership ensuring human oversight. © The Author(s) 2023.</abstract>

      <abstract>The use of algorithms and automated systems, especially those leveraging
artificial intelligence (AI), has been exploding in the public sector,
but their use has been controversial. Ethicists, public advocates, and
legal scholars have debated whether biases in AI systems should bar
their use or if the potential net benefits, especially toward
traditionally disadvantaged groups, justify even greater expansion.
While this debate has become voluminous, no scholars of which we are
aware have conducted experiments with the groups affected by these
policies about how they view the trade-offs. We conduct a set of two
conjoint experiments with a high-quality sample of 973 Americans who
identify as Black or African American in which we randomize the levels
of inter-group disparity in outcomes and the net effect on such adverse
outcomes in two highly controversial contexts: pre-trial detention and
traffic camera ticketing. The results suggest that respondents are
willing to tolerate some level of disparity in outcomes in exchange for
certain net improvements for their community. These results turn this
debate from an abstract ethical argument into an evaluation of political
feasibility and policy design based on empirics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) play an increasing
role in the public sector and invoke political discussions. Research
gaps exist regarding the disclosure effects-reactions to disclosure of
the use of AI applications-and the deployment effect-efficiency gains in
data savvy tasks. This study analyzes disclosure effects and explores
the deployment of an AI application in a preregistered field experiment
(n &#x3D; 2,000) co-designed with a public organization in the context of
employer-driven recruitment. The linear regression results show that
disclosing the use of the AI application leads to significantly less
interest in an offer among job candidates. The explorative analysis of
the deployment of the AI application indicates that the person-job fit
determined by the leaders can be predicted by the AI application. Based
on the literature on algorithm aversion and digital discretion, this
study provides a theoretical and empirical disentanglement of the
disclosure effect and the deployment effect to inform future evaluations
of AI applications in the public sector. It contributes to the
understanding of how AI applications can shape public policy and
management decisions, and discusses the potential benefits and downsides
of disclosing and deploying AI applications in the public sector and in
employer-driven recruitment.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: Big Data, sourced from various digital sources, offers
valuable insights for better decision -making, and organisations are
implementing Big Data technologies to improve their services. This
article is about how the City of Tshwane (CoT), a South African
metropolitan municipality is using data collected from its various
information and communication technology (ICT) projects to improve
decision -making. Objectives: The study aims to identify the type of Big
Data generated by South African municipalities and to establish ways in
which knowledge, expertise and suitable management techniques impact the
efficient application of Big Data in these municipalities. Method: A
qualitative approach, a case study method and Semi -structured
interviews were deemed fit to collect data while thematic analysis was
employed to identify patterns and themes associated with participants&#39;
experiences. Structuration Theory was used to analyse existing social
structures that govern how Big Data is used in the CoT. Results: There
is a lack of data integration and a Big Data management system in the
CoT. However, the CoT is ready to embrace Big Data and it is currently
establishing a unit to effectively analyse collected data. Conclusion:
Big Data&#39;s potential for developing effective data management systems
has garnered significant attention in the public sector and the CoT is
also ready to fully adopt and implement these technologies.
Contribution: South African municipalities can effectively utilise Big
data by establishing skilled staff, good infrastructure and suitable
policies for efficient data generation and interpretation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Over the past decade, the advent of new technology has brought about the emergence of smart cities aiming to provide their stakeholders with technology-based solutions that are effective and efficient. Insofar as the objective of smart cities is to improve outcomes that are connected to people, systems and processes of businesses, government and other public- and private-sector entities, its main goal is to improve the quality of life of all residents. Accordingly, smart tourism has emerged over the past few years as a subset of the smart city concept, aiming to provide tourists with solutions that address specific travel related needs. Dubai is an emerging tourism destination that has implemented smart city and smart tourism platforms to engage various stakeholders. The objective of this study is to identify best practices related to Dubai&#39;s smart city and smart tourism. In so doing, Dubai&#39;s mission and vision along with key dimensions and pillars are identified in relation to the advancements in the literature while highlighting key resources and challenges. A Smart Tourism Dynamic Responsive System (STDRS) framework is proposed while suggesting how Dubai may able to enhance users&#39; involvement and their overall experience. © 2017 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Data-driven decision making is needed in uncertain situations. Total
quality management is the source of quality management activities and
customer satisfaction. This study is related to the investigation into
the application of total quality management based on big data management
on the public sector in Korea. We developed a research model for total
quality management, and investigated the role of moderating big data
management between total quality management leadership and quality
management. Moreover, this study has examined the relationships between
the practices of the total quality management and using big data,
including customer needs and wants. The research model is developed and
tested to fit it is with the SEM (Structural Equation Model) analysis
using data 250 samples in Korea&#39;s public sector. The survey was
conducted between 1 August and 30 August 2019. The results are as
follow: Total quality leadership has significantly impacted total
quality management. Customer satisfaction was found to be significantly
affected by total quality management activities. In addition, the level
of big data management has the moderation effect between total quality
leadership and total quality management in Korea public sectors. It is
necessary to systematically manage data management in a situation where
the demand for improvement of public service is gradually increasing
online in public sector.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent user recognition technologies have focused on biometric signals to remotely identify users in the access management, medical welfare, and public sectors. The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is an individual&#39;s unique electrophysiological signal generated within the body and is difficult to forge or change; thus, it can be used to uniquely identify the user. Existing user identification systems based on ECG signals detect R peaks according to morphological features and use a fiducial-based segmentation process for data normalization. However, this process does not detect a distinct R peak due to motion artifacts generated by the movement of the subject, thereby degrading identification accuracy. To address the problem of decreasing peak accuracy of the fiducial-based segmentation data, this study proposes a user identification system based on one-dimensional neural networks using periodic non-fiducial-based segmentation data that do not overlap in the time domain. The proposed system comprises a preprocessing step for data denoising, a non-fiducial-based and non-overlap segmentation step, and a step for classifying users using a one-dimensional shallow neural network. In the experiment, when using self-acquired 10-second ECG signal data that were divided into non-fiducial and non-overlapping segments, the long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models achieved accuracies of 92.01%, 93.13%, and 95.51%, respectively, with the 1D CNN model exhibiting the best accuracy. The proposed system demonstrated a 25.48% improvement in accuracy on non-fiducial segmented data compared to the 1D CNN model, which achieved an accuracy of 70.03% on fiducial segmented data. Moreover, when tested on publicly available ECG datasets, including MIT-BIH, ECG-ID, and PTB-XL, the proposed system exhibited a user identification accuracy of over 94%, confirming its superior performance.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>To understand the community risk from severe weather threats, two components, including weather information and community assets, are crucial. Recently, probabilistic hazard information (PHI) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Forecasting a Continuum of Environmental Threats (FACETs) program has been developed to provide dynamic weather-related information between the watch and warning systems to weather forecasters, emergency management agencies, and the public. To predict community physical risks on critical infrastructure and building properties using PHI, building type information is required. This study applied a machine learning technique to predict building types using building footprint and city zoning data. We collected Oklahoma county building property data to train and test a random forest model. The result of this study showed that building footprint and city zoning data can be applied to classify multiple building types with an accuracy of 96%. The machine learning-based building classification contributed to the acquisition of building type data in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, metropolitan area. This geodatabase will be utilized to predict real-time critical infrastructure and building damage assessment using PHI. In addition to their importance to physical building damage assessment, the results can be utilized to develop postdisaster responses and planning.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Lifecare for quality-of-life improvement includes not only the prevention and treatment of diseases and health management anywhere and at any-time, but also the improvement of lifestyle, the psychological environment, and the emergency response. The construction of a sustainable model on the telecommunications platform as a solution has been constantly studied using intelligence information technology. In this study, sequential-index pattern mining on the lifecare telecommunications platform is proposed. The method is as follows. Various temporal and regional indices that are provided by the Meteorological Administration, Meteorological Data Open Portal, Public Data Portal, Healthcare Big Data Hub, and Korea Environment Corporation are collected as lifecare index data. The collected index data are transmitted to the NAS file server of the lifecare telecommunications platform using peer-to-peer (P2P)-based interconnection technology and high-performance computing. The sequential relationships among the indices are discovered to consider the semantic relationships. Using the AprioriAll mining algorithm, the maximum sequence is determined to find sequential relationships in the frequent sequence set. To process the pattern extraction and computation efficiently, recomposed transactions are stored in the high-performance NAS file server. Also, a mining-index prediction model is developed in consideration of the sequential relationships to complement the weakness of the statistical time-series analysis. Since the regional meteorological conditions are similar, the index sequential pattern can solve the problem of the generation of omissions or errors regarding the real-time monitoring data that are due to the monitoring equipment or communication failures. Therefore, the proposed sequential-index pattern mining can be utilized as a lifecare tool for risk-factor detection, risk prediction, and trend analysis. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>Information services based on Big Data analytics require data governance that can satisfy needs for corporate governance. While existing data governance focuses on data quality but Big Data governance needs to be established in consideration of a broad sense of Big Data services such as analysis of social trends and predictions of change. To achieve goals of Big Data services, strategies need to be established with alignment to the vision of the corporation. For successful implementation of Big Data services, there is needed a framework to enable initiation ofa Big Data project as a guide and method. We propose the Big Data Governance Framework to facilitate successful implementation in this study. Big Data governance framework presents additional criteria from existing data governance focused on data quality level. The Big Data governance framework focuses on timely, reliable, meaningful, and sufficient data services. The objective of Big Data services is what data attributes should be achieved based on Big Data analytics. In addition to the quality level of Big Data, personal information protection strategy and data disclosure&#x2F;accountability strategy are needed to prevent problems. This study conducted case analysis about the National Pension Service (NPS) of South Korea based on the Big Data Governance Framework we propose. Big Data services in the public sector are an inevitable choice to improve quality of life of people. Big Data governance and its framework are essential components for the realization of Big Data services&#39; success. In case-analyses, we identified vulnerabilities or risk areas, and we hope that these case studies will be used as major references to implement Big Data services without problems. © 2017, Academy of Business and Retail Management Research.</abstract>

      <abstract>In releasing the Algorithmic Transparency Standard, the UK government has reiterated its commitment to greater algorithmic transparency in the public sector. The Standard signals that the UK government is both pushing forward with the AI standards agenda and ensuring that those standards benefit from empirical practitioner-led experience, enabling coherent, widespread adoption. The two-tier approach of the Algorithmic Transparency Standard encourages transparency inclusivity across distinct audiences, facilitating trust across algorithm stakeholders. Moreover, it can be understood that implementation of the Standard within the UK’s public sector will inform standards more widely, influencing best practice in the private sector. This article provides a summary and commentary of the text. © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big data is being implemented with success in the private sector and science. Yet the public sector seems to be falling behind, despite the potential value of big data for government. Government organizations do recognize the opportunities of big data but seem uncertain about whether they are ready for the introduction of big data, and if they are adequately equipped to use big data. This paper addresses those uncertainties. It presents an assessment framework for evaluating public organizations’ big data readiness. Doing so demystifies the concept of big data, as it is expressed in terms of specific and measureable organizational characteristics. The framework was tested by applying it to organizations in the Dutch public sector. The results suggest that organizations may be technically capable of using big data, but they will not significantly gain from these activities if the applications do not fit their organizations and main statutory tasks. The framework proved helpful in pointing out areas where public sector organizations could improve, providing guidance on how government can become more big data ready in the future. © 2016, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>In many commercial and public sectors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is deeply embedded. Cyber security threats aimed at compromising the security, reliability, or accessibility of data are a serious concern for the IoT. Due to the collection of data from several IoT devices, the IoT presents unique challenges for detecting anomalous behavior. It is the responsibility of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to ensure the security of a network by reporting any suspicious activity. By identifying failed and successful attacks, IDS provides a more comprehensive security capability. A reliable and efficient anomaly detection system is essential for IoT-driven decision-making. Using deep learning-based anomaly detection, this study proposes an IoT anomaly detection system capable of identifying relevant characteristics in a controlled environment. These factors are used by the classifier to improve its ability to identify fraudulent IoT data. For efficient outlier detection, the author proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Attention Mechanism (ACNN-LSTM). As part of the ACNN-LSTM model, CNN units are deployed with an attention mechanism to avoid memory loss and gradient dispersion. Using the N-BaIoT and IoT-23 datasets, the model is verified. According to the N-BaIoT dataset, the overall accuracy is 99%, and precision, recall, and F1-score are also 0.99. In addition, the IoT-23 dataset shows a commendable accuracy of 99%. In terms of accuracy and recall, it scored 0.99, while the F1-score was 0.98. The LSTM model with attention achieved an accuracy of 95%, while the CNN model achieved an accuracy of 88%. According to the loss graph, attention-based models had lower loss values, indicating that they were more effective at detecting anomalies. In both the N-BaIoT and IoT-23 datasets, the receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve (ROC-AUC) graphs demonstrated exceptional accuracy of 99% to 100% for the Attention-based CNN and LSTM models. This indicates that these models are capable of making precise predictions. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>While FOSS solutions have attracted a significant amount of attention, alongside with necessary and growing IT related expenditure for the digitalization of public administration, authorities face the question of whether migration to such solutions is feasible and&#x2F;or worthwhile. The purpose of the presented work is to analyze existing domain research and extract key features, grouped in three major areas (namely Readiness, Ease of Use and Gain from migration), that should be investigated prior to a migration attempt. Following and building upon an extensive survey on Greek municipalities, the latter are categorized via the k-means non-supervised machine learning method to 3 levels of maturity regarding candidate participation in relevant projects. A combined scoring approach, based on similar features of the target FOSS solution as well as the aforementioned municipality categorization, is presented in order to detect a priori good candidate combinations (municipality and software) for minimizing a migration project risk. The method is validated through the aforementioned survey on municipalities with confirmed FOSS usage, indicating that selection in the proposed organized manner can aid in harvesting FOSS benefits. Furthermore, it is compared against a popular maturity model method (BPMMM) in order to comment on the applicability and classification process. © 2019</abstract>

      <abstract>Private businesses in sectors, such as food, energy, and retail, as well as public sector and federal agencies are interested in the predictive understanding of weather impacts on crop yield, which is an important aspect of food security. Scientific literature has mainly examined how crop yield is impacted by growing season-averaged weather indices. Although a few studies did consider weather extremes in their analysis, their scope was either restricted to measuring their conditional relationship with yield or the extreme event types considered were limited. Selection of regression models, whether the more commonly used linear approaches or nonlinear methods, have not been appropriately justified in this context. Here, we develop data-driven methods to examine two inter-related hypotheses for improved scientific understanding and enhanced predictive modeling. The first hypothesis, that extreme weather indices have a statistically significant information content in them is found to be valid based on linear and nonlinear methods for pairwise dependence. The second hypothesis, examines the value addition of nonlinear regression methods, and suggests that linear approaches may not alone be adequate. The results of this study can inform scientific understanding, generation and relevance of indices and end-to-end risk assessment systems in the context of climate impacts on crop yield. An immediate application may be in the context of NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) which facilitates the generation and dissemination of impacts relevant weather data and indices using a multitude of satellite-derived data sets and model outputs. © Copyright © 2020 Konduri, Vandal, Ganguly and Ganguly.</abstract>

      <abstract>Managing the groundwater resources is very vital for human life. This research proposes a methodology for predicting the groundwater levels which can be very valuable in water resources management. This study investigates the application of multilayer feed forward network models for forecasting the groundwater values in the region of Montgomery country in Pennsylvania. Multiple training algorithms and network structures were investigated to develop the best model in order to forecast the groundwater levels. Several multilayer feed forward models were created in order to be tested for their performance by changing the network topology parameters so as to find the optimal prediction model. The forecasting models were developed by applying different structures regarding the number of the neurons in every hidden layer and the number of the hidden network layers. The final results have shown a very good forecasting accuracy of the predicted groundwater levels. This research can be very valuable in water resources and environmental management. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.</abstract>

      <abstract>Research on user satisfaction has increased substantially in recent
years. To date, most studies have tested the significance of predefined
factors thought to influence user satisfaction, with no scalable means
of verifying the validity of their assumptions. Digital technology has
created new methods of collecting user feedback where service users post
comments. As topic models can analyse large volumes of feedback, they
have been proposed as a feasible approach to aggregating user opinions.
This novel approach has been applied to process reviews of primary care
practices in England. Findings from an analysis of more than 200,000
reviews show that the quality of interactions with staff and
bureaucratic exigencies are the key drivers of user satisfaction. In
addition, patient satisfaction is strongly influenced by factors that
are not measured by state-of-the-art patient surveys. These results
highlight the potential benefits of text mining and machine learning for
public administration.</abstract>

      <abstract>Electricity is hidden within wires and networks only revealing its quantity and flow when metered. The making of its properties into data is therefore particularly important to the relations that are formed around electricity as a produced and managed phenomenon. We propose approaching all metering as a situated activity, a form of quantification work in which data is made and becomes mobile in particular spatial and temporal terms, enabling its entry into data infrastructures and schemes of evaluation and value production. We interrogate the transition from the pre-digital into the making of bigger, more spatiotemporally granular electricity data, through focusing on those actors selling and materialising new metering technologies, data infrastructures and services for larger businesses and public sector organisations in the UK. We examine the claims of truth and visibility that accompany these shifts and their enrolment into management techniques that serve to more precisely apportion responsibility for, and evaluate the status of, particular patterns and instances of electricity use. We argue that whilst through becoming Big Data electricity flow is now able to be known and given identity in significantly new terms, enabling new relations to be formed with the many heterogeneous entities implicated in making and managing energy demand, it is necessary to sustain some ambivalence as to the performative consequences that follow for energy governance. We consider the wider application of our conceptualisation of metering, reflecting on comparisons with the introduction of new metering systems in domestic settings and as part of other infrastructural networks. © The Author(s) 2018.</abstract>

      <abstract>The cost of generating electricity in developing countries surpasses the
government&#39;s ability to sustain it, necessitating the involvement of the
private sector in this service provision through public-private
partnerships (PPPs) contracts. In Syria, the electricity system has been
highly susceptible to damage as a result of the ongoing crisis, leading
to frequent and prolonged blackouts. This research focuses on addressing
the need for a comprehensive system that aids decision-making for PPPs
contracts in the country. By employing a combination of studies,
reports, and interviews with domain experts, significant general and
exclusive factors that guide decision-makers in PPPs contracts are
identified and organized into questionnaires. These questionnaires are
then filled out by professionals engaged in PPPs contracts. The
collected data is analyzed and validated using SPSS software. However,
due to insufficient data collected, generative adversarial neural
networks (GAN) are utilized to enhance the research data. Additionally,
Expert Choice and the analytic hierarchy process are employed to
calculate weights for each factor. Remarkably, the calculated weights
for both general and exclusive factors align with real-life strategies.
General factors primarily address the financial and commercial
considerations associated with PPPs, while exclusive factors primarily
focus on the operational aspects of the electrical power system. These
factors are arranged in descending order of effectiveness, enabling
stakeholders to determine whether the private sector should be engaged
in the project or if it should remain within the public sector&#39;s
purview. The proposed system has demonstrated its reliability and can
serve as a promising starting point for PPPs contracts.</abstract>

      <abstract>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Urban administrators of major cities in India are planning to deploy advanced information technologies such as artificial intelligence to deliver e-governance services. It is expected to enable citizens to acquire relevant information to their commonly asked question without significant technological expertise. With its text, speech, and image processing capabilities similar to human beings, artificial intelligence is predicted to have both positive and negative social impact. The objective of this paper was to develop a conceptual framework consisting of enablers and barriers in adopting artificial intelligence enabled service delivery in a smart city from citizens’ perspectives. The study is novel in terms of empirically finding factors influencing adoption intention of artificial intelligence for availing citizen services in a nation like India which has a very large population and developing economy. METHODS: The study utilized an extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology framework and employed survey-based data collection technique. A structured survey was circulated as part of primary data collection. The responses were collected from 772 sample respondents from three upcoming smart cities in India and were further examined by deploying the structural equation modeling technique using IBM SPSS and AMOS tools. FINDINGS: The proposed framework in this research study has social implications in terms of key factors that are critical when conceptualizing government services using artificial intelligence to avoid any harmful effects on society. The findings demonstrated six enablers and three barriers significantly affecting adoption intention (p&lt;0.05) and explained 81 percent of the variance (R2) with the model’s Goodness-of-fit index above 0.9. The quantitative results are also validated with the case studies from six smart cities across the globe for designing and deploying artificial intelligence-based services in the public sector. CONCLUSION: The study highlights that the smart city management must make sufficient effort to ensure that artificial intelligence service delivery in a smart city is equitable for all socioeconomic levels of city residents. The study provides several policy recommendations for governments and technology service providers when deploying artificial intelligence-based services for citizens in developing countries like India. ©2024 The author(s).

      <abstract>The last decade has seen a rapid evolution of processing, analysis and visualization of freely available geographic data using Open Source Web-GIS. In the beginning, Web-based Geographic Information Systems employed a thick-client approach which required installation of platform-specific browser plugins. Later on, research focus shifted to platform-independent thin client solutions in which data processing and analysis was performed by the server machine. More recently, however, the rapid development of computer hardware as well as software technologies such has HTML5 has enabled the creation of platform-independent thick clients which offer advanced GIS functionalities such as geoprocessing. This article aims to analyse the current state of Open Source technologies and publicly available geographic data sources in the context of creating cost-effective Web-GIS applications for integration and processing of spatial data. For this purpose the article discusses the availability and potential of Web-GIS architectures, software libraries and data sources. The analysis of freely available data sources includes a discussion of the quality and accuracy of crowd-sourced as well as public sector data, while the investigation of software libraries and architectures involves a comparison of server-side and client-side data processing performance under a set of real-world scenarios. The article concludes with a discussion of the choice of cost-effective Web-GIS architectures, software libraries and data sources in the context of the institution and environment of system deployment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a proposal for the methodology of developing rescue plans and the concepts of applying recommended response schedules in the context of the State Fire Service’s planning responsibilities (preparation) and public administration (reconciliation and approval), according to the legal order in force in Poland. In the proposed concept, recommended schedules are built on the basis of the matches and successes identified according to the criteria, i.e. the best carried out rescue actions from the register of reports. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: The paper is based on the analysis of existing legal status and policy in Poland as well as the selected relevant academic literature. Findings: The result is the formulation of a methodology for drawing up the rescue plans to the extent required by law and proposing a concept for the method of developing and applying recommended response schedules, supporting operational planning and conducting rescue operations. Practical implications: The proposed methodology is to support the procedure of drawing up rescue plans by implying and implementing them into IT solutions. The suggested recommended response schedules, based on observations and conclusions from the analysis of the past rescue operations, may present circumstances and sequences of the use of forces and measures that have had beneficial effects in the past. An in-depth analysis of historical data from the conducted rescue operations may also be used to determine time indicators for the response phase. Originality&#x2F;value: The proposed solutions complement the methods currently used by public administration in Poland. The concept can also be inspiring for the State Fire Service (PSP) which has its own analytical tools in the form of a decision support system and registers of rescue operations carried out. The PSP may undertake the practical verification of the presented methodology for preparing rescue plans and recommended response schedules. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study examines public organisations planning big data-driven
transformations in their service provision. Without radical structural
change or managerial system changes, leaders face dilemmas: simply
bolting on big data makes little difference. This study is based on a
qualitative empirical case study using data collected from the cities of
Helsinki and Tampere in Finland. The three core dilemma pairs detected
and connected to the big data-related organisational changes are: (1)
repetitive continuity vs. visionary change, (2) risk-taking vs.
security-seeking and (3) technology-based development vs. human-based
development. This study suggests that organisational readiness involves
not only capabilities; instead, readiness involves absorbing knowledge,
making decisions, handling ambiguities, managing dilemmas. Thus, big
data-related transformations in public organisations require embracing
the world of dilemmas, since selected and cancelled experiments may each
have valuable outcomes. The capability to act on intentions is a
prerequisite for readiness; however, a preparedness to detect and
address dilemmas is central to big data-related transformations. Thus,
the ability to make dilemma decisions is a more complicated
characteristic of readiness. In conclusion, our data analysis suggests
that traditional public organisational and chance management approaches
produce unsolved dilemmas in big data-related organisational changes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Vehicle classification (VC) down to type and model is exclusively visual-&#x2F;image-based and struggles with restricted data availability and latency in data-sharing toward an increasing market of public and private mobility service providers. This article presents a framework architecture for VC down to type and model using a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) intrusive magnetic sensor system combined with advanced machine learning (ML). The framework follows the principles of &#39;privacy-by-design&#39; (PbD) and adds fuel identification as a new attribute. The framework was validated in an experiment on nine predefined passenger car models, confirming the capability of nonvisual sensors to classify vehicle type, model, and fuel. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly impact how transport and infrastructure agencies collect, process, and share intelligent traffic monitoring systems (ITMS) data in the future, providing more accurate and detailed information for improving roadway utilization efficiency, predicting transportation needs, enhancing transportation safety, and reducing environmental impact. The work proposes a system framework, experimental design, and evaluation against automatic number plate recognition. The evaluation involved collaboration among various partners, including academia, public road administration, and private companies, with diverse interests that need to be preserved due to significant development progress.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Civil servants play a crucial role in serving the government and the people, requiring them to possess both competent skills and organizational performance to fulfill the objectives of their respective organizations. To ensure the acquisition of high-quality civil servants with the right competencies and potential for promotion, a robust selection system is necessary. This paper focuses on utilizing data mining techniques to predict employee performance based on talent pool assessment results, thereby aiding in the identification of suitable candidates for target positions. The study employs predictive analytics to analyse the assessment data and predict the performance of employees in their designated roles. The data preprocessing stage involves the utilization of techniques such as one-hot encoding and feature selection to enhance the accuracy of the subsequent analysis. Several classification algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-NN, are utilized to train models and attain the highest possible accuracy for the assessment system. The application of data mining techniques in the field of Human Resources, particularly in the government sector, offers valuable insights for predicting the suitability and qualification of candidates for specific positions. By leveraging these techniques, organizations can effectively identify individuals who possess the necessary competencies to thrive in their assigned roles. Overall, this paper emphasizes the importance of a robust selection process for civil servants and presents a practical approach utilizing data mining techniques to predict employee performance. The results obtained from this study can contribute to the development of more efficient and reliable assessment systems in the public sector, enabling organizations to make informed decisions when assigning individuals to key positions. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

      <abstract>The objective of this study is to examine the effects of generative
artificial intelligence (AI) tools, with a specific focus on ChatGPT, on
the analytical proficiencies of policy analysts operating in Indonesia.
Considering the increasing intricacies of contemporary governance and
the emergence of &#x60;&#x60;wicked problems,&#39;&#39; this study investigates the
potential of AI to facilitate the development of inventive, data-centric
public policies. Involving postgraduate students in a quasi-experimental
design, this study investigated the efficacy of ChatGPT in assisting in
the development of policy solutions pertaining to air pollution in
Jakarta. Specialized prompt engineering techniques are utilized in this
study to enhance the utility of ChatGPT for policy analysis. The results
suggest that, although generative AI tools such as ChatGPT provide
systematic frameworks for tackling complex policy issues and may enhance
analytical skills, they still require additional refinement to increase
their empirical support and practical applicability in the Indonesian
policy context. In accordance with incrementalism theory, the study
concludes that incorporating AI into policy analysis can facilitate the
gradual formulation of evidence-based policies, offering a pragmatic
approach to the resolution of complex problems in the public sector.</abstract>

      <abstract>Computer simulation, an active learning technique, is now one of the advanced pedagogical technologies. Th e use of simulation games in the educational process allows students to gain a firsthand understanding of the processes of real life. Public- administration, public-policy and political-science courses increasingly adopt simulation games in universities worldwide. Besides person-to-person simulation games, there are computer-based simulations in public-administration education. Currently in Russia the use of computer-based simulation games in Master of Public Administration (MPA) curricula is quite limited. Th is paper focuses on computer- based simulation games for students of MPA programmes. Our aim was to analyze outcomes of implementing such games in MPA curricula. We have done so by (1) developing three computer-based simulation games about allocating public finances, (2) testing the games in the learning process, and (3) conducting a posttest examination to evaluate the effect of simulation games on students&#39; knowledge of municipal finances. Th is study was conducted in the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and in the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) during the period of September to December 2015, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Two groups of students were randomly selected in each university and then randomly allocated either to the experimental or the control group. In control groups (n&#x3D;12 in HSE, n&#x3D;13 in RANEPA) students had traditional lectures. In experimental groups (n&#x3D;12 in HSE, n&#x3D;13 in RANEPA) students played three simulation games apart from traditional lectures. Th is exploratory research shows that the use of computer-based simulation games in MPA curricula can improve students&#39; outcomes by 38 %. In general, the experimental groups had better performances on the post-test examination (Figure 2). Students in the HSE experimental group had 27.5 % better scores than students in the HSE control group. Students of the RANEPA experimental group had 38.0 % better scores than students in the RANEPA control group. Research indicates that lecture-based courses are less effective than courses with more interactive approaches. Therefore, our study highlights the need to implement computer-based simulation games in MPA programmes in Russian universities. Computer-based simulation games provide students with practical skills for their future careers. © NISPAcee 2018.</abstract>

      <abstract>The rush to understand new socio-economic contexts created by the wide
adoption of AI is justified by its far-ranging consequences, spanning
almost every walk of life. Yet, the public sector&#39;s predicament is a
tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential
algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own
efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing
by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a
matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms&#39; intrinsic
properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long
embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based
programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making
systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to
examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing
data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be
intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the
legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for
strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada;
&#x60;&#x60;optimising&#39;&#39; the employment services&#39;&#39; in Poland, and
personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper
advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential
impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it
discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on
public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a
more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the
potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are
controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in
light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the
underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become
crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large
scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time
accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships
between institutions and citizens could strengthen - or undermine -
trust in governance systems and democracy.</abstract>

      <abstract>The paper casts a spotlight on one of the manifold legal questions that arise with the proliferation of artificial intelligence. This new technology is attractive for many fields, including public administration, where it promises greater accuracy and efficiency, freeing up resources for better interaction and engagement with citizens. However, public powers are bound by certain constitutional constraints that must be observed, regardless of whether decisions are made by humans or machines. This includes the non-delegation principle, which aims to limit the delegation and sub-delegation of decisions affecting citizens’ rights in order to ensure governmental accountability, reviewability, and contestability. This puts some constraints on the automation of decision-making by public entities, as algorithmic decision-making entails delegating decisions to software development companies on the one hand, and to algorithms on the other. The present paper reveals and explains these constraints and concludes with suggestions to navigate these conflicts in a manner that satisfies the rule of law while maximizing the benefits of new technologies. © The Author(s) 2024.</abstract>

      <abstract>In its AI Act, the European Union chose to understand trustworthiness of AI in terms of the acceptability of its risks. Based on a narrative systematic literature review on institutional trust and AI in the public sector, this article argues that the EU adopted a simplistic conceptualization of trust and is overselling its regulatory ambition. The paper begins by reconstructing the conflation of “trustworthiness” with “acceptability” in the AI Act. It continues by developing a prescriptive set of variables for reviewing trust research in the context of AI. The paper then uses those variables for a narrative review of prior research on trust and trustworthiness in AI in the public sector. Finally, it relates the findings of the review to the EU&#39;s AI policy. Its prospects to successfully engineer citizen&#39;s trust are uncertain. There remains a threat of misalignment between levels of actual trust and the trustworthiness of applied AI. © 2023 The Authors.

      <abstract>Data analytics literature has not adequately addressed the empirical
investigation of dashboard evaluations. Instruments that measure the
dashboard dimensions and usefulness are yet to be proposed. This
research is geared toward this end. The objective is to examine the
theoretical underpinnings of data visualization using dashboards, to
develop and validate an instrument for the measuring of dashboard
usefulness in the public sector. Data collected from 160 dashboards of
public or government institutions were used to validate a measurement
model using structural equation modeling. PLS (Partial Least Squares)
techniques and the SPSS software were used to assess the model and
measures. Theoretical and practical implications are offered.</abstract>

      <abstract>With an accelerating increase of business benefits produced from big data analytics (if used appropriately and intelligently by businesses in the private and public sectors), this study focused on empirically identifying the big data analytics (BDA) attributes. These attributes were classified into four groups (i.e., value innovation, social impact, precision, and completeness of BDA quality) and were found to influence the decision-making performance and business performance outcomes. A structural equation modeling analysis using 382 responses from a BDA related to practitioners indicated that the attributes of representativeness, predictability, interpretability, and innovativeness as related to value innovation greatly enhanced the decision-making confidence and effectiveness of decision makers who make decisions using big data. In addition, individuality, collectivity, and willfulness, which are related to social impact, also greatly improved the decision-making confidence and effectiveness of the same decision makers. This shows that the value innovation and social impact, which have received relatively less attention in previous studies, are the crucial attributes for BDA quality as they influence the decision-making performance. Comprehensiveness, factuality, and realism, which are linked to completeness, also have similar results. Furthermore, the higher the decision-making confidence of the decision makers who used big data was, the higher the financial performance of their companies. In addition, high decision-making confidence using big data was found to improve the nonfinancial performance metrics such as customer satisfaction and quality levels as well as product development capabilities. High decision-making effectiveness with big data was also shown to improve the nonfinancial performance metrics.  © 2020 Tsinghua University Press.</abstract>

      <abstract>The maintenance and improvement of safety are among the most critical concerns in civil aviation operations. Due to the increased availability of data and improvements in computing power, applying artificial intelligence technologies to reduce risk in aviation safety has gained momentum. In this paper, a framework is developed to build a predictive model of future aircraft trajectory that can be utilized online to assist air crews in their decisionmaking during approach. Flight data parameters from the approach phase between certain approach altitudes (also called gates) are utilized for training an offline model that predicts the aircraft&#39;s ground speed at future points. This model is developed by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. Due to the myriad of model combinations possible, hyperband algorithm is used to automate the hyperparameter tuning process to choose the best possible model. The validated offline model can then be used to predict the aircraft&#39;s future states and provide decision-support to air crews. The method is demonstrated using publicly available Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The developed model can predict the ground speed at an accuracy between 1.27% and 2.69% relative root-mean-square error. A safety score is also evaluated considering the upper and lower bounds of variation observed within the available data set. Thus, the developed model represents an improved performance over existing techniques in literature and shows significant promise for decision-support in aviation operations. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

      <abstract>The paper aims to facilitate a discussion around how big data technologies and data from citizens can be used to help public administration, society, and policy-making to improve community&#39;s lives. This paper discusses opportunities and challenges of big data strategies for government, society, and policy-making. It employs the presentation of numerous practical examples from different parts of the world, where public-service delivery has seen transformation and where initiatives have been taken forward that have revolutionized the way governments at different levels engage with the citizens, and how governments and civil society have adopted evidence-driven policy-making through innovative and efficient use of big data analytics. The examples include the governments of the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and India, and different levels of government agencies in the public services of fraud detection, financial market analysis, healthcare and public health, government oversight, education, crime fighting, environmental protection, energy exploration, agriculture, weather forecasting, and ecosystem management. The examples also include smart cities in Korea, China, Japan, India, Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. This paper makes some recommendations about how big data strategies transform the government and public services to become more citizen-centric, responsive, accountable and transparent. © The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to transform the way we live, work, do business, and meet the needs of the public. While IoT&#39;s potential benefits for economic growth and social welfare appear to be indisputable, IoT faces several technological, social, legal, and regulatory policy challenges, ranging from interoperability and spectrum availability to cybersecurity and privacy. These challenges can and should be addressed by the joint efforts of a wide range of stakeholders from the public and private sector. The advancement of IoT depends in part on how policymakers respond to the opportunities and challenges associated with it. This research aims to identify the potential roles for the government in fostering the advancement of IoT innovation and adoption. To this end, we analyze data collected from 177 documents of public comments submitted to the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration and from a focus group discussion with senior managers. Our content data analysis results in a set of recommendations for the government in terms of general policy principles, specific policy prescriptions, and governance and process approach that facilitate policy development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>As the key to digital transformation, artificial intelligence is
believed to help achieve the goal of government as a platform and the
agile development of digital services. Yet we know little about its
potential role in local governance, especially the advances that
AI-supported services for the public sector in local governance have
ventured and the public value they have created. Combining the digital
transformation concepts and public value theory, we fill the gap by
examining artificial intelligence (AI) deployment in the public sector
of a pilot city of digital transformation in China. Using a mixed-method
approach, we show how AI configurations facilitate public value creation
in the digital era and identify four dimensions of AI deployment in the
public sector: data integration, policy innovation, smart application,
and collaboration. Our case analysis on these four dimensions
demonstrates two roles that AI technology plays in local
governance-&#39;&#39;AI cage&#39;&#39; and &#x60;&#x60;AI colleague.&#39;&#39; The former builds the
technology infrastructure and platform in each stage of service
delivery, regulating the behaviors of frontline workers, while the
latter helps frontline workers make decisions, thus improving the
agility of public service provision.</abstract>

      <abstract>Virtual humans are embodied agents with a human-like appearance. Despite the recent booming development that has sparked widespread academic interest, how people perceive these seemingly human but entirely fictional creations remains unclear. To explore the status, trends, emotional tendencies, and focus of attention of the Chinese public towards virtual humans, this paper utilizes text mining techniques to collect and analyze popular posts related to virtual humans on Chinese social media. The results indicate that public discussions primarily focus on the technological and industrial development of virtual humans, applications in the fields of virtual idols and virtual streamers, and the corporate investment and policy development of virtual humans. Despite positive emotions dominating, there is an increasing trend in negative emotions. Concerns are related to service failures, the uncanny valley effect, ethical crises, and technological unemployment. The research findings contribute to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and the public in understanding the general attitudes toward virtual human technology, enabling informed decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Ransomware has affected a broad range of public and private-sector organizations, and the impacts include direct and indirect financial loss (e.g., opportunity costs), reputational damage, legal implications, and physical consequences (e.g., fatalities). However, it has been challenging to accurately detect ransomware. For example, ransomware’s behavioral characteristics differ from many other malicious applications, and it can be laborious to obtain representative features that can be used for machine learning training. In addition, the issue of the imbalanced dataset of minority and majority classes complicates efforts for machine learning models to learn the internal patterns of minority classes. In an effort for tackling such difficulties, we suggest an architecture regarding Android ransomware detection (hereafter referred to as ARdetector), which allows one to analyze the relationship between behav oral characteristics and other candidate features associated with ransomware to select more representative features. In addition, we design a deep neural network based on focal loss, which lowers the loss generated by the majority class. In our evaluations, we use two real-world datasets of different class proportions, and the findings show that the accuracy of the ARdetector on both datasets is over 99.00% when the imbalanced ratio is 6. Specifically, via the BMR dataset, the AUC as a synthetical categorizing assessment indicator reaches as high as 0.9625 at that ratio of 15. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.</abstract>

With the development of big data and deep learning technology, the neural network method has been widely used for SOH and RUL estimations because of its excellent nonlinear mapping performance, adaptive performance and self-learning performance. In this paper, a novel hybrid model based on temporal convolutional network-long short-term memory (TCN-LSTM) for SOH and RUL estimations is proposed. The hyperparameters of each layer in the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization algorithm. Three different models, including convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model, temporal convolutional network (TCN) model and long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are adopted as comparisons to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. All the models are tested using two public battery datasets from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA dataset) and Oxford University (OX dataset). In SOH task, the TCN-LSTM model achieves an accuracy improvement of &gt;16 % and 14 % in NASA and OX datasets, respectively. In RUL task, the accuracies of the TCN-LSTM model and the CNN-LSTM model are superior to other models in NASA dataset; while the LSTM model and the CNN-LSTM model have better performance in OX dataset. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>The amount of data in many large departments is also very large, so the public sector will get some data from these places to explore its value. There are more people in the public sector and more daily activities, so it is more convenient to collect data. Starting from the field of advanced analysis, we can improve the effectiveness of the system and expand the internal transparency. If we start from the perspective of improving the efficiency of personalized service, we can better help people provide services and welfare. Of course, you can also start with the performance programmable gate array of services. There are also many factors in the society that can have a corresponding impact on big data. We should consider these factors. Whether they are favorable or unfavorable, they will have an unpredictable impact on the development of big data. After considering these factors, we will need to show and analyze the conditions, consider what technology to develop, and consider what kind of development solutions and solutions should be built to better complete our research. If our research field is relatively small, we can also expand our research field. Especially in the analysis of data and application of these aspects, because the research has been more thorough, so in order to obtain new research results, we must take the edge. In addition to the issues that must be considered, we also need to consider the sources of data and the integration system of data, as well as how to obtain data from the public sector. Due to the privacy protection of many public sector data, many sensitive data can not be directly obtained, need to be affirmed by the upper level, and we also need to ensure the security of the data obtained. © 2020</abstract>

      <abstract>The United Nations has established 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) as a global initiative to achieve a more sustainable future.
Within these goals, SDG16 emphasizes the significance of sustainable
public sector management, which profoundly influences the accomplishment
of other SDGs. Enhancing public service motivation is a critical element
in advancing sustainable public sector management. This study explores
the potential of mortality salience as an intervention to bolster public
service motivation, aiming to provide valuable insights for SDG16.
Specifically, the study investigates the varied effects of mortality
salience on public service motivation using a survey experiment and
employs machine learning techniques. The findings reveal a significant
positive impact of mortality salience on public service motivation.
Furthermore, this study highlights that this impact is more prominent in
organizations characterized by high levels of servant leadership and
extrinsic rewards, as well as low levels of organization-based
self-esteem. These findings have practical implications for fostering
sustainable public sector management in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study conducted measurements of microclimates and investigations of spatial environments and human activities in six typical waterfront public spaces in Shanghai. The aim was to explore the synergistic influence mechanism of public open space (POS) integrated microclimate (POSIM) on pedestrians’ activities to predict the utilization of public space. The measurement period was during the spring and early summer when outdoor activities were more diversified. 121 observation points were set up in urban waterfront public spaces, and an outdoor activity characteristic database of 25,583 people was established. In addition, multiple linear regression and nonlinear neural network models were introduced to analyze data from different types of activities to calculate the fitness of the models and the influence weights of the variables. The results indicated that the neural network had stronger predictive ability for the spatial integration of microclimate demands of different activities. The prediction degree for strolling and sitting activities was the highest, with R2 (goodness of fit) of 0.704 and 0.844, respectively, while the prediction degree for viewing and sports activities was lower (R2 &lt; 0.5). This study integrated the synergistic influence of urban waterfront public open spaces and microclimates factors on pedestrian outdoor activities to predict the preference patterns of different activities for spatial types. Focus on the requirements of space occupants, this study analyzed the public space environment from the bottom up and provided reference and inspiration for subsequent design optimization of urban waterfront areas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Wikipedia-based assignments have been adopted successfully in classrooms to improve learning outcomes. However, although this teaching method has been adopted regularly in Western higher education settings, more is needed in an international learning environment. Therefore, this research investigates how employing technology-mediated student-generated Wikipedia content can enhance learning outcomes in an international setting. This study adopted Wikipedia’s online user-generated content platform to create student-generated content in introductory Public Administration classes. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses to assess whether a Wikipedia writing assignment increased learning outcomes. Through pre-and post-surveys, students reported increased awareness of their English writing ability, knowledge of Wikipedia content writing, and knowledge of Wikipedia content writing. The study recommends adopting Wikipedia for introductory courses, especially relevant for courses taught in an international environment where English is the language of tuition. Nonetheless, instructors should act as active facilitators in group work, aid students in finding and shaping project topics, and narrow the project scope to ensure that it remains educational within the taught context. Furthermore, it is recommended to have a reasonable project length, design cross-group interactions, and include peer review and technical support in designing the project. © 2024 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>

      <abstract>Task scheduling scenarios require the system designers to have complete information about the resources and their capabilities, along with the tasks and their application-specific requirements. An effective task-to-resource mapping strategy will maximize resource utilization under constraints, while minimizing the task waiting time, which will in-turn maximize the task execution efficiency. In this work, a two-level reinforcement learning algorithm for task scheduling is proposed. The algorithm utilizes a deep-intensive learning stage to generate a deployable strategy for task-to-resource mapping. This mapping is re-evaluated at specific execution breakpoints, and the strategy is re-evaluated based on the incremental learning from these breakpoints. In order to perform incremental learning, real-time parametric checking is done on the resources and the tasks; and a new strategy is devised during execution. The mean task waiting time is reduced by 20% when compared with standard algorithms like Dynamic and Integrated Resource Scheduling, Improved Differential Evolution, and Q-learning-based Improved Differential Evolution; while the resource utilization is improved by more than 15%. The algorithm is evaluated on datasets from different domains like Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) datasets of public domain, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) datasets and others. The proposed method performs consistently on all the datasets. © 2024 IETE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Many countries are exploring the potential of artificial intelligence
(AI) to improve their operations and services, and China is no
exception. However, not all AI techniques or automation approaches are
suitable for every government service or process since transparency and
accountability are paramount in the public sector. In this context,
automation via expert systems (ES) is still a vital complement or even
an alternative to AI techniques, because they can be more easily audited
for potential biases. This paper analyzes the smart examination and
approval (SEA) process use in China and explores how different forms of
automation could be better options for certain services or specific
processes within services, considering their level of transparency as an
important characteristic. Based on these results, the authors argue that
governments could consider hybrid approaches combining, for example,
machine learning, for verification processes, and ES, which are more
easily auditable, to make final decisions on individual cases. They also
propose a classification of services by considering the extent of
automation and process transparency needed. The classification considers
a hybrid approach such as SEA, but also include other alternatives such
as the exclusive use of AI techniques, as well as traditional online
delivery and face-to-face procedures.</abstract>

      <abstract>The mineral raw materials industry is crucial for European industry, with the European Economic and Social Committee estimating that 70% of the industry relies directly or indirectly on its supply. In the context of a decarbonized and digitalized economy, the new European industrial model requires carbon-neutral raw materials and production processes. The crucial role of aggregates mining, as the primary construction material, emerges as a key supplier in this paradigm. Aggregates are the main component of the built environment and are a social and economic engine in most countries. Quarries of this type include a wide range of sizes and exploitation methods and use characteristic mining and processing equipment. Quarries are commonly close to their processing plants, which transform natural rock into crushed and ground materials with different grain sizes depending on the future uses. The quarry itself and the presence of certain equipment and facilities help distinguish it from mining sites that exploit other materials. Effective management of aggregates quarries is important in promoting circular economy practices, ensuring efficient management, reuse, and recycling of diverse wastes, including the recovery of high-value components and the production of recycled aggregates, and addressing construction and demolition waste (DCW) management. As aggregates become a progressively scarcer resource due to the increasing demand from developing countries, it is essential to provide reliable and comprehensive information on their potential to the public, policymakers, and other stakeholders to promote their use. This study focuses on employing artificial intelligence and computer vision analysis to automatically identify aggregates quarries from satellite images within continental Spain. A model has been trained to detect aggregates quarries from satellite images by computer vision. The model permits the detection of mining exploitation and the objects located at the interior, which permits determination of the type of mine and the activity status of it. The findings highlight the ability of artificial vision to discern quarries and distinguish whether the observed feature is an aggregates quarry. Additionally, the technology allows for the determination of the quarry’s operational status, distinguishing between active and abandoned quarries. The ability to detect the locations of quarries and assess their activity statuses is of significant value for resource exploration initiatives and location-allocation assessments. It can be a valuable tool for authorities involved in land planning, activities monitoring, and early detection of potential illegal mining activities. This analytical approach demonstrates substantial potential for various stakeholders, including mining companies, mining authorities, policymakers, and land use planners in both the private and public sectors. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Italian Public Administration (PA) relies on costly manual analyses
to ensure the GDPR compliance of public documents and secure personal
data. Despite recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have
benefited many legal fields, the automation of workflows for data
protection of public documents is still only marginally affected. The
main aim of this work is to design a framework that can be effectively
adopted to check whether PA documents written in Italian meet the GDPR
requirements. The main outcome of our interdisciplinary research is
INTREPID (artI ficial iNT elligence for gdpR compliancE of P ublic admI
nistration D ocuments), an AI-based framework that can help the Italian
PA to ensure GDPR compliance of public documents. INTREPID is realized
by tuning some linguistic resources for Italian language processing
(i.e. SpaCy and Tint) to the GDPR intelligence. In addition, we set the
foundations for a text classification methodology to recognise the
public documents published by the Italian PA, which perform data
breaches. We show the effectiveness of the framework over a text corpus
of public documents that were published online by the Italian PA. We
also perform an inter-annotator study and analyse the agreement of the
annotation predictions of the proposed methodology with the annotations
by domain experts. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the proposed
text classification model in detecting breaches of security.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is applied to various fields and
industries with the rapid development of Internet technology. This study
aims to promote the intelligent popularization of market public
management strategies based on data analysis through the development and
promotion of AI. AI technology is used to optimize the integration of
the Market Public Administration organizational structure system, and
machine algorithms process the data set. A public utility platform
management system is established, and a complete public utility
management assessment system and platform are based after classifying
the data. Research has found that AI technology has been used in the
Market Public Administration field to effectively improve work
efficiency and solve the duplication and complexity of work in the
management process. This has also opened a new chapter for the use of AI
technology innovation. The results show that AI technology uses two
driving logics of data and algorithms to intelligently solve the
management problems and form a complete operating system to reflect the
role of AI in the management system.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies on global sustainable development. Artificial intelligence
affects all three pillars of sustainable development: economic, social,
and environmental. Based on the generalization of academic works and
authoritative expert assessments, it is shown that this impact is
ambiguous. By increasing technological capabilities and enhancing the
efficiency of business, public administration, and the provision of
administrative and social services, AI creates a number of
socio-economic problems, primarily in the labor market, when hundreds of
professions are discredited and may disappear. It has been confirmed
that almost all sectors of the economy, including education and
medicine, are subject to the large-scale impact of AI. AI is able to
optimize the use of resources and increase energy efficiency, reducing
waste, thus affecting the environmental pillar of sustainable
development. The purpose of the article is a systematic study of the
intellectual and technological landscape of the global economy with a
cross-country analysis of its key indicators using the Kohonen
algorithm. The author has positioned artificial intelligence in the
technological paradigm of the twenty-first century. If scientific
progress in materials science, energy, and mathematical computing led to
the digital transformation with the emergence of Industry 4.0, then in
synergy with bio- and quantum technologies, AI will form Industry 5.0,
i.e., essentially a smart economy, through a technological explosion. To
recreate the current global intellectual and technological landscape,
the study used the Kohonen algorithm with the Deductor Studio package to
analyze 128 countries by 5 indicators. The modeling allowed us to group
them into 5 clusters, which makes a real comparative analysis possible.
Similar modeling with the implementation of the AI indicator (number of
robots per 10,000 population) for 18 countries allowed them to be
grouped into 3 clusters according to the level of readiness of
governments and society to interact with AI.</abstract>

      <abstract>The aim of this study is to determine the prerogatives of digital
modernization of the public administration system based on the
assessment of the development of digital government and the
identification of major barriers. That involves both organizational and
procedural changes and cultural changes in public authorities, personnel
and qualification structures, interaction with citizens, and the
effectiveness of public services. In the course of the study,
statistical methods were used (qualitative and quantitative analysis),
and empirical methods. Despite the automation of public authorities in
recent years, the results of the transfer of public services to
electronic format remain unsatisfactory. Digital modernization of the
public administration system involves expanding methods for analyzing
and evaluating the implementation of state programs, including auditing
the effectiveness of their implementation. Currently, the assessment
involves calculating the degree of achievement of the target values of
performance indicators of projects, and monitoring is the assessment of
the share of key events (activities) that occurred on time. The use of
technologies of predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence has
significantly changed the quality of information and analytical support
of decisions. &#x60;&#x60;Big data&#39;&#39; processing technologies contribute to the
adaptation of public policy measures to the needs and characteristics of
the recipients of regulation.

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security intelligence modeling can be used to prevent, detect, and manage cyber threats. Data-driven AI solutions are currently undergoing rigorous research and design changes in their own field, but few scholars or practitioners frame authorized push payment (APP) scams as a unique cybersecurity concern, or tailor technical solutions based on local regulatory contexts. Drawing on a recent consultation publication by the UK Payment Systems Regulator on APP scams (November 2021), this article shows how AI can be leveraged to manage APP scams and explores some of the opportunities and risks one should consider when adopting such an approach. We highlight three scenarios: 1) Liability on payment service provider; 2) Liability on payor; and 3) Liability on payor with substantial public sector involvement. These examples illustrate how sociotechnical systems can play a design role, and consequently assist industry leaders and engineering management in prioritizing investment focus, strategic approaches, and technical solutions.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big data have become a game-changer for modern public administration in those areas in which they are used. Although their application is still limited in the public sector, their use develops dynamically in areas where they bring tangible results in terms of efficiency and efficacy. This article presents the concept of big data, outlines the possibilities for using big data in the public sector and methods of their utilization, highlights cases where these have been implemented, along with the results. This article discusses applications of big data methods in public policy design and implementation and in public authority internal management. It includes a summary of the benefits, disadvantages and challenges related to utilization of big data. The article also briefly addresses historical, current and predictive approaches. Research was carried out using internet-based case analysis and is limited by the confidentiality of details relating to big data methods. Although the research has had to be limited to publicly available descriptions, the findings make it possible to understand the big data phenomenon in public administration and to draw general lessons from their use. Points for practitioners: Big data is a contemporary phenomenon. Properly utilized it brings astonishingly positive outcomes for public administration in terms of its efficacy, efficiency, and overall client satisfaction. These benefits are a result of significant increase in the accuracy of decision-making, a significant acceleration of performance of internal the ‘information task’ and a significant reduction in operating costs related to the decision-making process. This is possible thanks to the digitization of human life and IT developments applied in a specific way for public administration – the way of big data methods where huge amounts of data are processed in a form of reasoning by powerful IT technology to present information that helps public administration to better perform its task. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public administrators receive conflicting signals on the transformative
benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the counternarratives of
AI&#39;s ethical impacts on society and democracy. Against this backdrop,
this paper explores the factors that affect the sensemaking of AI
benefits in Canadian public administration. A mixed-method research
design using PLS-SEM (n &#x3D; 272) and interviews (n &#x3D; 38) tests and
explains the effect of institutional and consultant pressures on the
perceived benefits of AI use. The quantitative study shows only service
coercive pressures have a significant effect on perceived benefits of AI
use and consultant pressures are significant in generating all
institutional pressures. The qualitative study explains the results and
highlights the underlying mechanisms. The key conclusion is that in the
earlier stages of AI adoption, demand pull is the main driver rather
than technology push. A processual sensemaking model is developed
extending the theory on institutions and sensemaking. And several
managerial implications are discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper presents an analysis of interviews, focus groups and workshops with employees in the technical administration in the municipality of Copenhagen in the year after it won a prestigious Smart City award. The administration is interpreted as a ‘most likely’ to succeed in translating the idealised version of the smart city into a workable bureaucratic practice. Drawing on the work of Orlikowski and Gash, the empirical analysis identifies and describes two incongruent ‘technological frames’ that illustrates different ways of making sense of data and the smart city within this single organisational unit. One is called the experimentalist’s credo and it is characterised by inspiration from the development of an Internet of Things as well as a readiness to learn from the open source community in software development. The other is called the data-owners vocation and it is characterised by a more situated approach that interprets data as strategic and political. It is argued that the existence of these frames provides two insights relevant for the literature on smart cities. First, they illustrate that one should be careful not to reify the smart city as a phenomenon that can be criticised in generic terms. Second, they suggest that even if there exists a transition toward the implementation of a technocratic smart city paradigm across public administrations, this paradigm is not unique in its focus on markets and evidence in governance. © The Author(s) 2018.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study investigated the determinants of public sector managers&#39;
intentions to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) systems within their
organizations. An extended technology acceptance model (TAM) was
developed, incorporating additional constructs including fairness,
humanity, reliability, safety, transparency, accountability, privacy,
security, trust, social norms, tolerance, impact, and isomorphic
pressure. A survey was conducted among 330 public sector managers, and
the data were analyzed using linear regression tests to evaluate the
model. The results showed significant positive influences of both
perceived usefulness and perceived impact on managers&#39; attitudes and
behavioral intentions toward AI adoption. Isomorphic pressure was also a
significant determinant of managers&#39; behavioral intentions toward
adopting AI systems. Our findings also indicated that perceptions
related to AI ethical principles, such as transparency, privacy, and
security, influenced managers&#39; trust in AI systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>Cognitive Computing Systems (CCSs) are increasing in prominence in the public sector. This paper develops a framework drawing on public value and information technology service management literature to guide the management of CCSs in the public sector. We draw on academic literature, gray literature, legislation and government reports, and examples on CCS initiatives in the public sector to develop insights for research and practice. We then outline the themes and present the insights in the form of guiding principles and specific (detailed) recommendations. These include guiding principles and recommendations for establishing legitimacy, understanding the required capabilities, executing capabilities, creating and measuring public value. © 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>

      <abstract>We assess the labor market experiences and earnings of military veterans, focusing on three major outcomes, among others, controlling for a wide array of demographic characteristics and industry and occupational fixed effects. First, we find that male and female veterans receive civilian earnings nearly equivalent to nonveteran men and women. This finding implies that military experience is valued in the labor market similarly to foregone civilian experience. Second, veterans are clustered in occupations with somewhat lower than average employment and real earnings growth, and in metropolitan areas with lower levels and growth of real GDP per capita. Third, veterans experience lower returns to formal educational investments (e.g., college) than do nonveterans. Veterans realize earnings gains from professional licenses, but their returns are lower than for nonveterans. These gains are concentrated among science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) jobs, suggesting that veterans could help meet the growing demand for tech talent and artificial intelligence skills. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.</abstract>

      <abstract>The concept of Big Data has become very popular over the last decade, with large technology companies successfully building their business models around its exploitation. The public sector in the United Kingdom has tried to follow suit and local governments in particular have tried to introduce new models of service delivery based on the routine extraction of information from their own Big Data. These attempts have been hailed as the beginning of a new era for the public sector where service delivery and commissioning are shaped by data intelligence on local needs and by evidence on the outcomes. In this article we assess this claim and the extent to which it captures the way local governments in the United Kingdom use intelligence from Big Data in light of the structural barriers they face when trying to exploit their data. We also present a case study on the development and deployment of an integrated data model for children services in a large county council in the South-East of England. © 2016 Policy Studies Organization</abstract>

      <abstract>The value of data is growing every day. Data is a key factor in both scientific research and public administration. The development of IT technologies has led to the generation of a large amount of personal data, which has become the basis for the development of machine learning technologies and big data processing. This growing demand is bringing renewed interest in data privacy practices and processes. The study of the strength of a hashed message is of great importance in modern authentication systems. The hashing process is inextricably linked to the password system, since passwords are usually stored in the system not in clear text, but in the form of hashes. The SHA-256 hash function was chosen to model therainbow tables attack. An algorithm for constructing a rainbow table for the SHA-256 hash function in the Cryptool 2 environment is proposed. The conditions under which the use of rainbow tables will be effective are determined. This article aims to practically show the process of generating a password and rainbow tables to organize an attack on the SHA-256 hash function. Studies show that rainbow tables can reveal a password without salt faster than with salt. As the password bit increases, the decryption time increases in direct proportion. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study explains the emergence of virtual classrooms as an online language learning (OLL) instruction method. There is clarification of how virtual classroom systems operate, followed by a discussion of the benefits of learning in these environments. Private corporations are capitalizing on OLL and generating an estimated global gross income of 86 billion USD. While these corporations likely create quality educational materials that are of interest to the student, the materials presented in these platforms are currently not regulated, and, while some companies follow CEFR guidelines, there is no guarantee whether they meet the standards of education boards in the public sector. We surveyed 35 OLL teachers who teach English in virtual classrooms for their perceptions and opinions in working in this environment. Not only did we discover that over 50 percent of the online teachers who participated have also been students, which is of interest because they have both teaching and learning experience in virtual classrooms, but also that these teachers generally believe that teaching English online in virtual classrooms creates a positive teaching environment for both the teacher and the student. The participants generally feel they get to know the students better in virtual classrooms than in other teaching environments. The teachers also perceive that students in virtual classrooms learn at the same rate or faster than in traditional classrooms and that, not only would they like to see more subjects offered online, but they also generally believe that online learning in virtual classrooms may be an alternative learning method to replace traditional classroom learning and home-schooling in most subjects. Continued attention should be paid to the educational opportunities in virtual classrooms, not just for OLL, but for the emergence of other curricula as well. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>Communication is a critical government function that has important implications for public administration and effective governance. This research study explores how communication competencies are taught in public affairs programs in the United States. Based on a general web content analysis of graduate programs, and specific analyses of course titles, course descriptions, and course syllabi, this study examines the extent to which communication competencies are integrated into public affairs curricula. This paper also discusses how communication skills map on to the five NASPAA core competencies. Compared to previous decades, communication courses are increasingly emphasized in public administration programs. But there is greater potential for such offerings in the age of digital government, social media, and Artificial Intelligence. This study’s findings have important implications for the teaching and practice of public affairs. © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is viewed as having great potential for the
public sector to improve the management of internal activities and the
delivery of public services. However, realizing its potential depends on
the proper implementation of the technology, which is characterized by
unique factors, that afford or constrain its use. What these factors are
and how they affect AI implementation is still poorly understood, and
scholars call for studies to add empirical evidence to the existing
knowledge. This study relies on a case study methodology and, by
adopting an abductive approach, applies a double theoretical
perspective: the Technology-OrganizationEnvironment (TOE) framework and
the Technology Affordances and Constraints Theory (TACT). Drawing on
these combined lenses, we develop a conceptual framework that extends
previous studies by showing how AI implementation is the result of a
combination of contextual factors that are deeply interrelated and,
specifically, how AI-related factors bring new affordances and
constraints to the application domain.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article aims to examine the use of artificial intelligence by public administrations in a legal context characterized by the absence of general regulation and centered on the Courts ex post regulation. Starting from a case relating to a Ministry of Education’s plan based on an algorithm, it analyzes the effectiveness of the European Data Protection Regulation and the actual role of the “human in the loop” principle, considering the different types of algorithm applicable and the legal background and expertise of public officials operating with artificial intelligence. © 2020.

      <abstract>This article aims to explore the challenges associated with providing digital resources to stakeholders and identifying the obstacles and barriers to the successful design and exploitation of digital resources in the classroom and a wider learning environment. As a direct consequence of Covid-19 and the physical closure of schools we can now identify three specific content-producing cultures emerging within the educational community (Marcus-Quinn, A., T. Hourigan, and S. McCoy. 2019a. “‘The Digital Learning Movement: How Should Schools Respond?’.” Economic and Social Review 50 (4): 767–783). On the top tier we can see the independently developed resources by private educational companies that have been designed with accessibility hardwired into the resources. Such accessibility caters to the widest range of user needs. The second tier provides digital materials that have been produced by teachers in schools that have a ‘tech-driven’ agenda; such schools do not make it mandatory for teachers or students to use privately produced books. The third tier comprises teachers, outside of a formal community of practice, who use privately produced resources but modify them to suit their student needs better. There has been a rapid migration to digital learning as a direct response to the challenges posed by Covid-19 in schools (Mohan, G., S. McCoy, E. Carroll, G. Mihut, S. Lyons, and C. Mac Domhnaill. 2020. “Learning for all? Second-level education in Ireland during COVID-19.” ESRI Survey and Statistical Report Series 92 June 2020.). As schools have scrambled to adapt to this ever-changing environment, digital inclusion has never been more critical as school communities now navigate these new learning experiences (Hall, Byrne et al. 2021; Marcus-Quinn, A., and T. Hourigan. 2021. Handbook for Online Learning Contexts: Digital, Mobile and Open: Policy and Practice. Cham: Springer.; Murphy, C., A. Marcus-Quinn, and T. Hourigan. 2021a. “Exploring the Ripple Effect of ‘Always On’Digital Work Culture in Secondary Education Settings.” In Handbook for Online Learning Contexts: Digital, Mobile and Open, edited by A. Marcus-Quinn and T. Hourigan, 339–353. Cham: Springer, Murphy, C., A. Marcus-Quinn, and T. Hourigan. 2021b. “Technostress in Secondary Education Settings.” Coping with COVID: Advancing Education. The Naace Journal 89: 17–23). To comply with European legislation passed in 2019, public sector organisations and private companies and organisations need to check the accessibility of their websites, mobile apps, and media content (Oncins, E., and P. Orero. 2021. “Let&#39;s put Standardisation in Practice: Accessibility Services and Interaction.” Hikma 20 (1): 71–90. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie&#x2F;en&#x2F;Planning&#x2F;Digital-Learning-Framework-and-Planning-Resources-Post-Primary&#x2F;Digital-Learning-Framework-for-Post-Primary-Schools.pdf). The educational publishing sector should also adhere to these common accessibility standards ensuring that digital content conforms to digital equity, diversity, and inclusion principles (Mihut, G., S. McCoy, and B. Maître. 2021. “A Capability Approach to Understanding Academic and Socio-emotional Outcomes of Students with Special Educational Needs in Ireland.” Oxford Review of Education.). During the Covid-19 pandemic it became clear that there is an appetite for high-quality open-access digital teaching and learning materials (Eivers, E., J. Worth, and A. Ghosh. 2020. Home Learning During COVID-19: Findings from the Understanding Society Longitudinal Study. Slough: National Foundation for Educational Research.). To improve the consistency and reusability of such resources the education community would benefit from easy access to shared quality templates that are professionally designed and usability tested. Such an initiative is unlikely to happen without buy-in from publishers in conjunction with the Department of Education. Such collaboration was behind the successful establishment of Scoilnet: Ireland’s national repository for shared digital teaching and learning materials. During the pandemic Scoilnet compiled a list to highlight the Open-access resources available to stakeholders and requested that teachers make recommendations and upload such resources to the Scoilnet portal. It is clear that such resources need to be designed and developed, and this requires professional time and resources. We cannot expect this to happen without cost. © 2022 Educational Studies Association of Ireland.</abstract>

      <abstract>Household surveys give a precise estimate of poverty; however, surveys
are costly and are fielded infrequently. We demonstrate the importance
of jointly using multiple public and private sector data sources to
estimate levels and changes in wealth for a large set of countries. We
train models using 63,854 survey cluster locations across 59 countries,
relying on data from satellites, Facebook Marketing information, and
OpenStreetMaps. The model generalizes previous approaches to a wide set
of countries. On average, across countries, the model explains 55% (min
&#x3D; 14%; max &#x3D; 85%) of the variation in levels of wealth at the survey
cluster level and 59% (min &#x3D; 0%; max &#x3D; 93%) of the variation at the
district level, and the model explains 4% (min &#x3D; 0%; max &#x3D; 17%) and
6% (min &#x3D; 0%; max &#x3D; 26%) of the variation of changes in wealth at the
cluster and district levels. Models perform best in lower-income
countries and in countries with higher variance in wealth. Features from
nighttime lights, OpenStreetMaps, and land cover data are most important
in explaining levels of wealth, and features from nighttime lights are
most important in explaining changes in wealth.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work we attempt to study the turnover aspect in an organization located in a country in the Middle East, namely, Jordan. This organization consists of 1000 employees and it works in the service sector. A questionnairee was harvested from 280 employees in this organization throughout an entire year. Afterwards, a statistical study has been conducted. In addition, a soft clustering (SC) algorithm has been leveraged to construct a turnover prediction model. The model divides the employees into three clusters depending on the survey results. At the end of the year, the predicted clusters and the actual results from the company’s records have been compared. 84% of the employees clustered in the mobile cluster voluntarily turned over. Moreover, our results showed that public sector and abroad contracts are the main criteria of turnover. This statistical study, also, indicated that the HR department should take serious steps to improve the quality of the work environment in order to reduce the turnover rate in this company. These steps vary from small management gratitude to employees to financial incentives. Copyright © Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (ZUJ)</abstract>

      <abstract>Increasing attention is paid to ethical issues and values when designing
and deploying artificial intelligence (AI). However, we do not know how
those values are embedded in artificial artefacts or how relevant they
are to the population exposed to and interacting with AI applications.
Based on literature engaging with ethical principles and moral values in
AI, we designed an original survey instrument, including 15 value
components, to estimate the importance of these values to people in the
general population. The article is based on representative surveys
conducted in Estonia, Germany, and Sweden (n &#x3D; 4501), which have varying
experiences with implementing AI. The factor analysis showed four
underlying dimensions of values embedded in the design and use of AI:
(1) protection of personal interests to ensure social benefit, (2)
general monitoring to ensure universal solidarity, (3) ensuring social
diversity and social sustainability, and (4) efficiency. We found that
value types can be ordered along the two dimensions of resources and
change. The comparison between countries revealed that some dimensions,
like social diversity and sustainability evaluations, are more
universally valued among individuals, countries, and domains. Based on
our analysis, we suggest a need and a framework for developing basic
values in AI.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this article, we analyze the perspectives of professional training
for public administration workers, starting from the insights gained
from online courses run during the past two years in the context of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In order to understand the nature, type, and
magnitude of the changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic in the field
of continuous professional training for public administration, we
carried out a systematic bibliographic analysis, as well as
questionnaire-based empirical research conducted among public
institution employees in Romania. This article was conducted based on
the hypothesis that the professional training activities over the past
two years have been organized predominantly online, and we aim to
analyze the sustainability of these new teaching systems&#x2F;methods. The
limitations of the study are due to the fact that each administrative
system has structural particularities and its own legal framework
regarding the professional training of public administration workers;
for this reason, the proposed model may not be successfully applied in
all countries. We provide a model of online professional training for
public administration workers that includes sustainability criteria and
is based on experience accumulated over the past two years.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the legal conditions under which governments may use green artificial intelligence (AI) in city planning. Although Japan was one of the early countries to release its general AI principles, it has been relatively slow in establishing conditions where administrative agencies may use AI. Granted, there have been some recent scholarship that discusses the usage of AI in general under Japanese administrative law, but the use of green AI in city planning under Japanese law has not yet been discussed. Hence, this paper intends to focus on green AI in city planning and discuss the conditions for usage based on different categories of AI. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: This paper conducts a legal analysis on the utilization of AI for the purpose of sustainable city planning and administration in Japan. The approach of this paper is to summarize the existing scholarship in Japanese administrative law and analyse the new elements in the new field of green AI in city planning. This paper is not a natural science paper. The social science method of jurisprudence is used. This paper cites only public sources, and no informal literature has been referenced. Findings: This paper establishes the conditions where Japanese central and local government may use green AI in city planning from a legal viewpoint based on three categories. The categories are green AI usage in city planning concerning things, green AI usage in city planning concerning people and green AI usage in city planning concerning automated decision-making. Research limitations: This research is limited to an analysis of Japanese law, which means that issues other than law are not included in this paper. Further, although general legal issues are discussed, this paper is intended to discuss Japanese law issues only, and foreign laws are not discussed. Therefore, this paper mostly cites Japanese language papers published in domestic journals. Practical implications: The intended practical implication of this paper is to allow central and local governments to determine – based on the proposed categories – whether green AI can be used for city planning purposes and under which conditions. The authors hope that this will assist the Japanese government in establishing rules on the usage of AI by governmental agencies and allow for the greater actual usage by Japanese central and local governments of green AI in future city planning. Social implications: As the theme of this paper deals with governmental use (and the function of a government is to serve society), the social implications at issue can be said to be equivalent to the practical implication. Originality&#x2F;value: There have been articles discussing Japanese administrative law restrictions on AI in general. However, as of now, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no articles published focusing on green AI used for city planning. The authors note that the green AI used for city planning would have different legal implications from AI’s usage by the government in general, such as the chatbot used by the agencies or lethal autonomous weapons by the military force. Therefore, this paper is original in focusing on green AI used for city planning. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>Digital healthcare promises to achieve cost-efficiency gains, improve clinical effectiveness, support better public sector governance by enhancing transparency and accountability, and increase confidence in medical diagnoses, especially in the field of oncology. This article aims to discuss the benefits offered by digital technologies in tax-based European healthcare systems against the backdrop of structural bureaucratic rigidities and a slow pace of implementation. Artificial intelligence (AI) will transform the existing delivery of healthcare services, inducing a redesign of public accountability systems and the traditional relationships between professionals and patients. Despite legitimate ethical and accountability concerns, which call for clearer guidance and regulation, digital governance of healthcare is a powerful means of empowering patients and improving their medical treatment in terms of quality and effectiveness. On the path to better health, the use of digital technologies has moved beyond the back office of administrative processes and procedures, and is now being applied to clinical activities and direct patient engagement. © 2020 The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>What is worth reasserting from the tradition begun by Refounding Public Administration? In this time of reboots and remixes in pop-culture, it may seem trite to suggest reevaluating an established scholarly paradigm. But, in the continued absence of a strong theory of Public Administration and the emergence of new challenges to administrative practice, it is worth revisiting the key concepts of the Refounding tradition to show how this successful normative theory might help solve key problems in contemporary public administration, such as incorporation of algorithmic decision making into public agencies. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.</abstract>

      <abstract>The sharing of data between States, particularly during a transnational public emergency, is essential for, e.g., monitoring adequate responses. Yet, in the digital economy, it is the private sector that leads in the collection and processing of huge amounts of data on a global scale, while the public sector often lags behind. We begin the article by examining the shortcomings of the solutions developed in human rights law and in international economic law concerning access to public sector information and data. Afterwards, we propose three possibilities to provide adjustments of the regulatory framework governing data sharing in the era of big data: sectoral approach to data sharing, establishment of common standards for public sector information re-use, and the idea of &#39;data altruism&#39; introduced in the Data Governance Act. We indicate how these solutions could facilitate the development of an international regulatory framework for data sharing on an international level. © 2022 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.</abstract>

      <abstract>Introduction: Urine cytology offers a rapid and relatively inexpensive method to diagnose urothelial neoplasia. In our setting of a public sector laboratory in South Africa, urothelial neoplasia is rare, compromising pathology training in this specific aspect of cytology. Artificial intelligence-based synthetic image generation—specifically the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs)—offers a solution to this problem. Materials and methods: A limited, but morphologically diverse, dataset of 1000 malignant urothelial cytology images was used to train a StyleGAN3 model to create completely novel, synthetic examples of malignant urine cytology using computer resources within reach of most pathology departments worldwide. Results: We have presented the results of our trained GAN model, which was able to generate realistic, morphologically diverse examples of malignant urine cytology images when trained using a modest dataset. Although the trained model is capable of generating realistic images, we have also presented examples for which unrealistic and artifactual images were generated—illustrating the need for manual curation when using this technology in a training context. Conclusions: We have presented a proof-of-concept illustration of creating synthetic malignant urine cytology images using machine learning technology to augment cytology training when real-world examples are sparse. We have shown that despite significant morphologic diversity in terms of staining variations, slide background, variations in the diagnostic malignant cellular elements, the presence of other nondiagnostic cellular elements, and artifacts, visually acceptable and varied results are achievable using limited data and computing resources. © 2022 American Society of Cytopathology</abstract>

      <abstract>Research in the field of public administration has changed and advanced
significantly in recent years. These advancements concern both how we
engage in research-such as the methods we apply, the interdisciplinary
nature of the theories we use, and the research questions we ask.
Increasingly, we are witnessing a shift in public-sector values away
from efficiency and effectiveness and toward a paradigm that highlights
equity. In this article, we reflect on these changes from our position
as editors-in-chief of some of the leading journals in the field. In
addition to describing the progress of this discipline, we explore
emerging windows of opportunity for new research. One such window is
research on ways to incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives and
methods. We also see the need for work in such areas as social equity,
comparative administration, artificial intelligence, and climate change.
Finally, we argue for a more proactive approach in disseminating
research to those involved in the day-to-day decision-making processes
of public organizations.</abstract>

      <abstract>Over 1300 federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the US provide care to vulnerable populations in different contexts, addressing diverse patient health and socioeconomic characteristics. In this study, we use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure FQHC performance, applying several techniques to account for both quality of outputs and heterogeneity among FQHC operating environments. To address quality, we examine two formulations, the Two-Model DEA approach of Shimshak and Lenard (denoted S&#x2F;L), and a variant of the Quality-Adjusted DEA approach of Sherman and Zhou (denoted S&#x2F;Z). To mitigate the aforementioned heterogeneities, a data science approach utilizing latent class analysis (LCA) is conducted on a set of metrics not included in the DEA, to identify latent typologies of FQHCs. Each DEA quality approach is applied in both an aggregated (including all FQHCs in a single DEA model) and a partitioned case (solving a DEA model for each latent class, such that an FQHC is compared only to its peer group). We find that the efficient frontier for the aggregated S&#x2F;L approach disproportionately included smaller FQHCs, whereas the aggregated S&#x2F;Z approach’s reference set included many larger FQHCs. The partitioned cases found that both the S&#x2F;L and S&#x2F;Z aggregated models disproportionately disfavored (different) members of certain classes with respect to efficiency scores. Based on these results, we provide general insights into the trade-offs of using these two models in conjunction with a clustering approach such as LCA. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a threat to global health and requires collaborative health research efforts across organizations and countries to address it. Although routinely collected digital health data are a valuable source of information for researchers, benefiting from these data requires accessing and sharing the data. Health care organizations focusing on individual risk minimization threaten to undermine COVID-19 research efforts, and it has been argued that there is an ethical obligation to use the European Union&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) scientific research exemption during the COVID-19 pandemic to support collaborative health research. Objective: This study aims to explore the practices and attitudes of stakeholders in the German federal state of Bavaria regarding the secondary use of health data for research purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on the GDPR scientific research exemption. Methods: Individual semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted between December 2020 and January 2021 with a purposive sample of 17 stakeholders from 3 different groups in Bavaria: researchers involved in COVID-19 research (n&#x3D;5, 29%), data protection officers (n&#x3D;6, 35%), and research ethics committee representatives (n&#x3D;6, 35%). The transcripts were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: Participants identified systemic challenges in conducting collaborative secondary-use health data research in Bavaria; secondary health data research generally only happens when patient consent has been obtained, or the data have been fully anonymized. The GDPR research exemption has not played a significant role during the pandemic and is currently seldom and restrictively used. Participants identified 3 key groups of barriers that led to difficulties: the wider ecosystem at many Bavarian health care organizations, legal uncertainty that leads to risk-adverse approaches, and ethical positions that patient consent ought to be obtained whenever possible to respect patient autonomy. To improve health data research in Bavaria and across Germany, participants wanted greater legal certainty regarding the use of pseudonymized data for research purposes without the patient&#39;s consent. Conclusions: The current balance between enabling the positive goals of health data research and avoiding associated data protection risks is heavily skewed toward avoiding risks; so much so that it makes reaching the goals of health data research extremely difficult. This is important, as it is widely recognized that there is an ethical imperative to use health data to improve care. The current approach also creates a problematic conflict with the ambitions of Germany, and the federal state of Bavaria, to be a leader in artificial intelligence. A recent development in the field of German public administration known as norm screening. © Stuart McLennan, Sarah Rachut, Johannes Lange, Amelia Fiske, Dirk Heckmann, Alena Buyx.</abstract>

      <abstract>New technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain are changing how the public sector serves constituents. Academic programs in public administration and public policy must adapt their coursework to best serve students in an increasingly technology-based world. This qualitative research analyzed 84 Asian public administration graduate programs to determine the degree to which information technology was taught throughout the region. Our findings indicate that considerable variation existed between the number of information technology classes offered and the types of information discussed in the classes. A majority of public administration programs throughout Asia offered coursework in information technology; but, core classes and IT-specific specializations in public administration programs were observed at a much lower rate. Discussions of the tactics taken by programs to educate students in information technologies provide actionable suggestions for practitioners, educators, researchers, and administrators alike. © The Author(s) 2020.</abstract>

      <abstract>E-Governance or electronic governance is a procedure of public sector regulation and is a significant step in the transformation of municipal administration, with the intention of confiding and smoothing collaboration among the population and civic establishments through Information and Communications Technology-based applications. Content Confidentiality has become a serious anxiety for modern Information Societies. The sensitive nature of much of the private personal data that are exchanged or released to untrusted parties necessitates that liable administrations should embark on suitable content confidentiality protection mechanisms. Nowadays, many of these data are texts (e.g., emails, messages posted in social media, healthcare outcomes, etc.) that, because of their unstructured and semantic nature, constitutes a challenge for automatic data protection methods. In this paper, we present a solution for position confidentiality conserving content protection in e-Governance services through computational intelligence. We propose PCCA, a novel position confidentiality conserving algorithm for content protection in e-Governance. The proposed algorithm applies computational intelligence in e-Governance for content protection by means of rule-based approach from computational intelligence and users current position information. A simulation model has been implemented on a desktop PC and evaluation using roaming users real-time position-based information demonstrates that PCCA can efficiently conserve roaming users position confidentiality while accomplishing better performance, guaranteed position confidentiality, and better quality of service in e-Governance. © 2017 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>Smart cities are presented as both inevitable and benign futures: the technological development is unstoppable and will bring us wealthier, safer and more sustainable cities. Putting technology to use, however, is never entirely a matter of engineering but of strategic, political and value-laden choices. This article combines the literature on technology in the public sector and on (urban) governance to develop a public governance perspective on smart cities. The central theoretical concept &quot;datapolis&quot;highlights how the construction of smart cities can be understood in term of &quot;actors,&quot;&quot;rules,&quot;and &quot;games&quot;of urban governance. The theoretical analysis results in the identification of three types of actors (state, market, and civil society), three governance challenges (balancing perceptions, guaranteeing checks and balances and building upon different forms of knowing), and five governance games (the politics of data collection, data storage, data usage, data visualization and data access). The governance of smart cities is re-conceptualized as the socio-technical structures that emerge from the governance games. The governance challenge is to develop legitimate rules for perceptions, power relations and decisions in smart cities. © 2017 The Author(s) 2017.

      <abstract>The nature and production of migration statistics are in flux. State bureaucracies are no longer the primary source of migration data. Instead, there are a myriad unofficial data sources and processing collaborations which produce migration and mobility data as a by-product of both commercial and governmental processes. This has implications both for international processes of migration assessment and control, and for states’ domestic policies with respect to migrants. This paper brings together migration studies with Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature to take stock of these new data sources’ theoretical and empirical implications for both migrants and the links between migration and broader social processes. We identify migration information infrastructures: configurations of data assemblages which involve private and public sector actors, where data originally collected for one purpose (billing customers, sharing social information, sensing environmental change) become repurposed as migration statistics. We explore the implications of such migration information infrastructures for migration researchers: what are the entanglements that such infrastructures bring with them, and what do they mean for the ethics and practicalities of doing migration research?. © 2024 The Author(s).

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted by public sector organizations to provide better public services and to transform their internal processes. AI is now considered a key enabler for digital innovation and transformation in the public sector. However, AI is still relatively a new research area in the field of digital government. The term, AI, captures a wide range of technologies, techniques, and tools such as machine&#x2F;deep learning, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, and more recently Generative AI. While these AI technologies afford different applications and benefits in the gov- ernment context, they also create social, ethical, and legal challenges. These challenges require solutions combining both technical (e.g., data and algorithmic solutions to minimize bias) and institutional (e.g., governance structures and processes) mechanisms. The special issue is a collection of articles that contribute to a better understanding of the issues associated with AI deployment in different areas of government operations. They cover AI applications in the areas of emergency re- sponse, policy analysis, public bids, and citizen participation. The contributions also address the challenge of realizing a legal transparency regime for AI in government and the effect of AI in bureaucratic decision-making.

      <abstract>Intellectual capital refers to the set of intangible assets that create competitiveness in public and private organizations and has a strategically significant role concerning resources, capacities and organizational performance. However, the academic output on intellectual capital in public administration is limited. The present study was conducted in public organizations in Tamaulipas, Mexico, and Arequipa, Peru; both countries are developing economies. The aim was to analyze the effects of human and structural capital on performance in public administration. A total of 502 questionnaires were administered to public employees in the two countries, using the neural networks technique and structural equation modeling. We found that human capital positively impacted organizational performance, and this relationship was mediated by structural capital. Thus, we recommend implementing structural and human capital management practices, given their role in enhancing the performance in public organizations. © 2022 Universidad ICESI.

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has pervaded everyday life, reshaping the
landscape of business, economy, and society through the alteration of
interactions and connections among stakeholders and citizens.
Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of AI presents significant risks
and hurdles, sparking apprehension regarding the trustworthiness of AI
systems by humans. Lately, numerous governmental entities have
introduced regulations and principles aimed at fostering trustworthy AI
systems, while companies, research institutions, and public sector
organizations have released their own sets of principles and guidelines
for ensuring ethical and trustworthy AI. Additionally, they have
developed methods and software toolkits to aid in evaluating and
improving the attributes of trustworthiness. The present paper aims to
explore this evolution by analysing and supporting the trustworthiness
of AI systems. We commence with an examination of the characteristics
inherent in trustworthy AI, along with the corresponding principles and
standards associated with them. We then examine the methods and tools
that are available to designers and developers in their quest to
operationalize trusted AI systems. Finally, we outline research
challenges towards end-to-end engineering of trustworthy AI by-design.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose
This study aims to achieve three goals: present a holistic, flexible and
dynamic model; define the model&#39;s factors and explain how these factors
lead to effective and efficient usage of big data; and generate indexes
based on experts&#39; input to rank them based on their importance.
Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach
This paper uses the analytic hierarchy process, a quantitative method of
decision-making, to evaluate the importance of the factors presented in
the model. The fundamental principle of the overall model is that of a
dynamo which is borrowed from electromagnetic physics. The model is also
based on three IS theories.
Findings
Technological advancements and data security are among the most
important factors that may impact the effectiveness and efficiency of
big data usage. Authentication, governments&#39; focus on it and
transparency and accountability are the most important factors in
techno-centric, governmental-centric and user-centric factors,
respectively.
Research limitations&#x2F;implications
The findings of this paper confirmed earlier findings in the literature
and quantitatively assessed some of the factors that were conceptually
presented. This paper also presented a framework that can be used in
future studies.
Practical implications
Policy and decision-makers may need to upgrade pertinent technologies
such as internet security, frame policies toward information technology
(IT) and train the users.
Originality&#x2F;value
This paper fills a gap in the literature by presenting a comprehensive
study of how different factors dynamically contribute to the effective
usage of big data in the public sector. It also quantitatively presents
the importance of the factors based on the data collected from 12 IT
experts.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study aims to fill a gap in the literature by identifying, defining, and evaluating the critical success factors that impact the implementation of data intelligence in the public sector. Fourteen factors were identified, and then divided into three categories: organization, process, and technology. We used the analytical hierarchy process, a quantitative method of decision-making, to evaluate the importance of the factors presented in the study using data collected from nine experts. The results showed that technology, as a category, is the most important. The analysis also indicated that project management, information systems &amp; data, and data quality are the most important factors among all fourteen critical success factors. We discuss the implications of the analysis for practitioners and researchers in the paper. © 2021</abstract>

      <abstract>Public sector organizations are increasingly interested in using data science and artificial intelligence capabilities to deliver policy and generate efficiencies in high-uncertainty environments. The long-term success of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector relies on effectively embedding it into delivery solutions for policy implementation. However, governments cannot do this integration of AI into public service delivery on their own. The UK Government Industrial Strategy is clear that delivering on the AI grand challenge requires collaboration between universities and the public and private sectors. This cross-sectoral collaborative approach is the norm in applied AI centres of excellence around the world. Despite their popularity, cross-sector collaborations entail serious management challenges that hinder their success. In this article we discuss the opportunities for and challenges of AI for the public sector. Finally, we propose a series of strategies to successfully manage these cross-sectoral collaborations.

      <abstract>Evidence-based decision making is promoted as offering efficiency and
effectiveness; however, its uptake has faced barriers such as
underdeveloped supporting culture, limited access to evidence, and
evidence that is not fully relevant. Smart city conceptualizations offer
economic and environmental sustainability and better quality of life
through evidence-based policy decision-making. We wondered whether smart
city theory and practice has advanced the knowledge of evidence-based
decision-making. We searched major databases for literature containing a
mention of smart cities, decision-making, and policy. We identified
relevant literature from a range of disciplines and supplemented these
by following backwards and forwards citations. Evidence-based
decision-making was found mostly in literature regarding the theory and
practice of smart city operations, and, to lesser extents, the articles
regarding policy decisions and tactical decisions. Better
decision-making which supported the achievement of city sustainability
objectives was reported in some articles; however, we found significant
obstacles to the further achievement of city objectives in the areas of
underachievement in collaborative decision-making, privileging of big
data evidence, and artificial intelligence agents as decision-makers. We
assembled a definition of smart city decision-making and developed an
agenda of research which will support city governments, theorists, and
practitioners in better achieving sustainability through improved
decision-making.</abstract>

      <abstract>Inequality has become a defining feature of our time and concerns are growing that artificial intelligence, human-enhancement and global ecological breakdown could cause levels to spiral upwards. Although public disapproval of current inequalities is widespread, studies also show that people don&#39;t desire equality, but prefer ‘fair’, still significant inequalities. Here, I argue these preferences are rooted in ideals of meritocracy and intuitive notions of free will; values that&#39;ll become increasingly tenuous in a future of human enhancement, where they could legitimise mass inequalities. Maintaining an illusion of free will is often argued to be needed to disincentivise immoral behaviour, but it also creates a vicious feedback: It provides social legitimacy to substantial inequalities, which exacerbate precisely those immoral behaviours that the illusion is intended to mitigate. However, meritocratic values, and their foundational notion of individual agency, are neither natural nor inevitable – they&#39;re mediated by social practices. To see what egalitarian practices may look like, I review the rich anthropology literature on egalitarian societies. This highlights an irony, in that the meritocratic ideals proposed by contemporary politicians as a remedy to entrenched inequalities are the same values seen as the origin of inequality in existing egalitarian societies around the world. © 2021 The Author(s)</abstract>

      <abstract>Using an embedded mixed method design, we compared a nationally representative sample of US adults and a sample of US-based emergency managers (EM) on their attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and their intentions to rely on AI in a set of decision-making scenarios relevant to emergency management. Emergency managers reported significantly less positive attitudes toward AI and were less likely to rely on AI for decisions compared to the nationally representative sample. Our analysis of EMs&#39; open-ended responses explaining their choices to use or not use AI-based solutions reflected specific concerns about implementation rather than wariness toward AI generally. These concerns included the complexity of the potential outcomes in the scenarios, the value they placed on human input and their own extensive experience, procedural concerns, collaborative decision-making, team-building, training, and the ethical implications of decisions, rather than a rejection of AI more generally. Managers&#39; insights integrated with our quantitative findings led to a person-environment fit framework for AI implementation in the public sector. Our findings and framework have implications for how AI systems should be introduced and integrated in emergency managerial contexts and in public sector organizations more generally. Public managers&#39; perceptions and intentions to use AI and organizational oversight processes are at least as important as technology design considerations when public sector organizations are considering the deployment of AI. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>

      <abstract>- An essential national practice in the general growth of societies and
economies is the quick integration of digital capabilities, innovations,
and IT skills with government services in public sector. The adoption of
digital capabilities and technological advancements renders more
efficacy and efficiency to the delivery of public sector government
services. The increasing demands of corporations and residents, however,
present a significant challenge for the governments. In order to exploit
emerging digital technologies, government needs to engage, interact and
cooperate with residents, society, and enterprises. It must structure
itself and guarantee that appropriate technology is put to use.
Technology and innovation must be strategically incorporated in the
initiatives to modernize public sector services. The objective of the
study is to investigate the impact of various factors like digital
capabilities, technology skills, innovation, and data capabilities on
the implementation of AI enabled public services. The study uses the
Governments&#39; Artificial Intelligence Readiness Index score of 100
countries from Oxford Insights and IDRC. The results imply that use of
AI in public services has a significant impact on the purchase of
cutting-edge technology, data, and innovative capabilities of a nation.</abstract>

      <abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic placed significant stress on an already overburdened health system. The diagnosis was based on detection of a positive RT-PCR test, which may be delayed when there is peak demand for testing. Rapid risk stratification of high-risk patients allows for the prioritization of resources for patient care. The study aims were to classify patients as severe or not severe based on outcomes using machine learning on routine laboratory tests. Data were extracted for all individuals who had at least one SARS-CoV-2 PCR test conducted via the NHLS between the periods of 1 March 2020 to 7 July 2020. Exclusion criteria: those 18 years, and those with indeterminate PCR tests. Results for 15437 patients (3301 positive and 12,136 negative) were used to fit six machine learning models, namely the logistic regression (LR) (the base model), decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), convolutional neural network (CNN) and self-normalising neural network (SNN). Model development was carried out by splitting the data into training and testing set of a ratio 70:30, together with a 10-fold cross-validation re-sampling technique. For risk stratification, admission to high care or ICU was the outcome for severe disease. Performance of the models varied: sensitivity was best for RF at 75% and accuracy of 75% for CNN. The area under the curve ranged from 57% for CNN to 75% for RF. RF and SNN were the best-performing models. Machine Learning (ML) can be incorporated into the laboratory information system and offers promise for early identification and risk stratification of COVID-19 patients, particularly in areas of resource-poor settings. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study examines how big data analytics could optimize the use of public funds while ensuring delivery of quality service by public organizations to the citizens of Mauritius. Political Economic Social Technological (PEST) analysis has been carried out to scan the environment to identify at least two major policies and initiatives corresponding to big data that will be impacting the Mauritian Economy in the next 10 years. Subsequently, causal layered analysis (CLA) has been applied for the two signals to create transformative spaces for the creation of alternative futures. Indeed, the findings have demonstrated that open data initiative and the implementation of e-health project in Mauritius would certainly contribute positively to the government of Mauritius. However, this study has revealed through a matrix diagram for probable futures that the Mauritian government should bring amendments to existing conventional laws through reforms and regulations to fully take advantage of big data analytics applications. This is also one of the recommendations of the Mauritius e-Government 2013–2017–Formulation and Implementation of Data Sharing Policy. Considering only the recent emergence of big data analytics in governments, still there is certain aspect of it that needs careful consideration before the full potential of big data could be realized. This research also highlights the factors that need to be addressed for the successful use of Big Data in this particular context. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big data has become a significant research area due to the birth of
enormous data generated from various sources like social media, internet
of things and multimedia applications. Big data has played critical role
in many decision makings and forecasting domains such as recommendation
systems, business analysis, healthcare, web display advertising,
clinicians, transportation, fraud detection and tourism marketing. The
rapid development of various big data tools such as Hadoop, Storm,
Spark, Flink, Kafka and Pig in research and industrial communities has
allowed the huge number of data to be distributed, communicated and
processed. Big data applications use big data analytics techniques to
efficiently analyze large amounts of data. However, choosing the
suitable big data tools based on batch and stream data processing and
analytics techniques for development a big data system are difficult due
to the challenges in processing and applying big data. Practitioners and
researchers who are developing big data systems have inadequate
information about the current technology and requirement concerning the
big data platform. Hence, the strengths and weaknesses of big data
technologies and effective solutions for Big Data challenges are needed
to be discussed. Hence, due to that, this paper presents a review of the
literature that analyzes the use of big data tools and big data
analytics techniques in areas like health and medical care, social
networking and internet, government and public sector, natural resource
management, economic and business sector. The goals of this paper are to
(1) understand the trend of big data-related research and current frames
of big data technologies; (2) identify trends in the use or research of
big data tools based on batch and stream processing and big data
analytics techniques; (3) assist and provide new researchers and
practitioners to place new research activity in this domain
appropriately. The findings of this study will provide insights and
knowledge on the existing big data platforms and their application
domains, the advantages and disadvantages of big data tools, big data
analytics techniques and their use, and new research opportunities in
future development of big data systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we first frame the use of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems in the public sector as a continuation and intensification of
long-standing rationalization and bureaucratization processes. Drawing
on Weber, we understand the core of these processes to be the
replacement of traditions with instrumental rationality, that is, the
most calculable and efficient way of achieving any given policy
objective. Second, we demonstrate how much of the criticisms, both among
the public and in scholarship, directed towards AI systems spring from
well-known tensions at the heart of Weberian rationalization. To
illustrate this point, we introduce a thought experiment whereby AI
systems are used to optimize tax policy to advance a specific normative
end: reducing economic inequality. Our analysis shows that building a
machine-like tax system that promotes social and economic equality is
possible. However, our analysis also highlights that AI-driven policy
optimization (i) comes at the exclusion of other competing political
values, (ii) overrides citizens&#39; sense of their (non-instrumental)
obligations to each other, and (iii) undermines the notion of humans as
self-determining beings. Third, we observe that contemporary scholarship
and advocacy directed towards ensuring that AI systems are legal,
ethical, and safe build on and reinforce central assumptions that
underpin the process of rationalization, including the modern idea that
science can sweep away oppressive systems and replace them with a rule
of reason that would rescue humans from moral injustices. That is overly
optimistic: science can only provide the means - it cannot dictate the
ends. Nonetheless, the use of AI in the public sector can also benefit
the institutions and processes of liberal democracies. Most importantly,
AI-driven policy optimization demands that normative ends are made
explicit and formalized, thereby subjecting them to public scrutiny,
deliberation, and debate.</abstract>

      <abstract>Open data allows new experiments in administration, both in terms of activities and organisation. In terms of composite procedures, open data can serve many public interests in new ways, leading to faster and more accurate decision-making (already at the preparatory level), while it remains difficult to ensure effective judicial protection for individuals in shared administration between the EU and the Member States. In this context, procedural guarantees at the decision-making stage should not be neglected, even more if we consider the EU public administration as a platform, offering data as services, exchanging information and data, cooperating, and competing with public and private actors. Relying on the power of data, however, requires resilient rules, based on EU principles as to assure the rule of law, and able to cope with the challenges of the digital transition, as to ensure the &quot;effectiveness&quot;of administrative activities implementing EU law in each Member State.  © 2024 The Author.</abstract>

      <abstract>Living in the era of “big data” demands an increase in the application and development of solutions for data ingestion in agroecological research, both in the private and public sectors. Among available data sources, satellite imagery is a viable solution to acquire large amounts of data at cheaper costs. Although cloud-based commercially distributed services are flourishing, open-source software able to assist practitioners and researchers in downloading and pre-processing satellite imagery is strongly demanded by the remote sensing community. This is especially true when looking at applications developed in Python, a programming language that quickly gained popularity in agroecological science. In this letter, we introduce nasawebservice version 1.0.0, a Python Package designed to automatically collect remotely sensed data from the NASA MODIS&#x2F;VIIRS Land Products web service. The nasawebservice package contains a set of classes and methods to facilitate download operations for practitioners and researchers and to implement user-friendly data ingestion pipelines in local and cloud environments. The main advantage of nasawebservice is the reduction of pre-processing operations to use satellite images due to getting the data in JSON format, with consequent saving of computational time for large data download and analytic operational pipelines. © 2023</abstract>

      <abstract>The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in chatbots, virtual assistants, and ATMs reduces technical inefficiency in Indian commercial banks. The impact of (AI) on the technical efficiency of 47 examined commercial banks in India has reduced technical inefficiency to 11%, primarily due to internal factors or decision making. The verdict endorses the speeding up of (AI) deployment besides raising the level of assets, reducing the nonperforming assets, especially banks functioning in the public sector. © 2021 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose of Study: The present study was designed to study possibilities, conditions, grounds and limitations regarding the use of technologies and units of artificial intelligence in public administration. Determinants of the need to use such technologies in public administration were also considered. In this study, directions of realizable engagement which is already implemented, as well as directions of the possible use of artificial intelligence units in the future for public administration were investigated to ensure the functioning of system of state executive bodies.Methodology: The present research carried out based on the application of research methods such as system analysis, synthesis, and classification. Using these research methods, the concepts of describing conditions, possibilities, modes and functional-target load of using technologies and units of artificial intelligence in public administration, as well as limitations of its application in public administration were developed.Results: It was found that the use of artificial intelligence by the state for performing its various own tasks is highly relevant as it might lead to finding many positive approbations. However, despite the fact that technologies and artificial intelligence units have been developed for a relatively long time, and some of them are already widely used, it is still impossible to talk about the integrated, fully tested and properly regulated implementation of this kind of technology and units for management, therefore, it is suggested to further investigate on this issue from a theoretical (prognostic) point of view, taking into account potential directions and possibilities regarding the use of such technology and units.Implications&#x2F;Applications: The use of technologies and units of artificial intelligence does not necessarily take into account as a panacea for solving the problems and may not lead to solving some systemic problems in public administration, but, on the contrary, may even aggravate some existing problems in public administration and contribute to the emergence of new problems and risks. © Morkhat et al.</abstract>

      <abstract>Introduction: NCDs (non-communicable diseases) are considered an important social issue and a financial burden to the health care systems in the EU which can be decreased if cost-effective policies are implemented, along with proactive interventions. The CrowdHEALTH project recognizes that NCD poses a burden for the healthcare sector and society and aims at focusing on NCDs’ public health policies. Aim: The aim of this paper is to present the concept of Public Health Policy (PHP), elaborate on the state-of-the-art of PHPs development, and propose a first approach to the modeling and evaluation of PHPs used in a toolkit that is going to support decision making, the Policy Development Toolkit (PDT). Methods: The policy creation module is a part of the PDT aiming to integrate the results of the rest of the health analytics and policy components. It is the module that selects, filters, and aggregates all relevant information to help policy-makers with the decision making process. The policies creation component is connected to the visualization component to provide the final users with data visualization on different PHPs, including outcomes from data-driven models, such as risk stratification, clinical pathways mining, forecasting or causal analysis models, outcomes from cost-benefit analysis, and suggestions and recommendations from the results of different measured KPIs, using data from the Holistic Health Records (HHRs). Results: In the context of CrowdHEALTH project, PHP can be defined as the decisions taken for actions by those responsible in the public sector that covers a set of actions or inactions that affect a group of public and private actors of the health care system. In the CrowdHEALTH project, the Policy Development Toolkit works as the main interface between the final users and the whole system in the CrowdHEALTH platform. The three components related to policy creation are: (i) the policy modeling component, (ii) the population identification component and (iii) the policy evaluation component. In policy evaluation, KPIs are used as measurable indicators to help prevent ambiguity problems in the interpretation of the model and the structure. Conclusions: This initial Policy creation component design might be modified during the project life circle according to the concept complexity. © 2020 Konstantinos Moutselos, Ilias Maglogiannis, Dimosthenis Kyriazis, Andrea Gil Granados, Vassilis Plagianakos, Alexandra Papageorgiu, Septimiu Nechifor, John Mantas, Andriana Magdalinou, Lydia Montandon</abstract>

      <abstract>The role of education systems is crucial in creating bilingualism and multilingualism. Based on domestic and foreign literature and structured interviews with public officials in North Macedonia and Italy, the article analyses the solutions and incentives for institutional bilingualism, which have proven insufficient thus far. It also offers a model of multilingualism as a concept of an ideal environment where speakers can communicate using multiple languages. The impact of new information and communication technologies on language learning and use in bilingual areas and their contribution to the creation of an ideal environment conducive to multilingualism will also be examined. The data obtained shows, among other things, that artificial intelligence is also revolutionising language use and learning. Nonetheless, despite rapid progress, human communication in different languages cannot be replaced by artificial algorithms. © Author 2023.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online learning has been considered a successful source for reaching learners anywhere, and anytime despite all challenges for decades. This two-fold study was designed to explore how COVID-19 fear affected students’ social presence in online learning, and how their internal psychological resources such as motivation moderated to make their online learning experience successful in public, and private universities. A cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational research design was carried out by using a simple random sampling (N&#x3D;244 students from Public sector universities, and N&#x3D;178 students from Private universities). Online structured questionnaires were developed to collect data by using Google forms. The study found fear of COVID-19 highly insignificant in relationship with Social Presence, while Cognitive Problem-Solving Skill was significant with Psychological Motivation in Public Sector universities. Psychological Motivation also exhibited a strong positive and significant correlation with Cognitive Problem-Solving Skills. The study concluded that in Public Sector Universities, the existence of fear of COVID-19 was accompanied by greater psychological motivation among students, resulting in an increase in their cognitive problem-solving ability. While in Private Sector universities fear of COVID-19 was seen having a significant relationship with Social Presence, Cognitive Problem-Solving capability, and Psychological Motivation. In Private Sector universities, fear of COVID-19 was also accompanied by greater psychological motivation among students, resulting in an increase in their social presence. © 2021 Conscientia Beam.

      <abstract>The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequent global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the public administrations of different countries to establish health procedures and protocols based on information generated through predictive techniques and models, which, in turn, are based on technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This article presents some AI tools and computational models used to collaborate in the control and detection of COVID-19 cases. In addition, the main features of the Epidempredict project regarding COVID-19 in Panama are presented. This initiative consists of the planning and design of a digital platform, with cloud-based technology, to manage the ingestion, analysis, visualization and exportation of data regarding the evolution of COVID-19 in Panama. The methodology for the design of predictive algorithms is based on a hybrid model that combines the dynamics associated with population data of an SIR model of differential equations and extrapolation with recurrent neural networks. The technological solution developed suggests that adjustments can be made to the rules implemented in the expert processes that are considered. Furthermore, the resulting information is displayed and explored through user-friendly dashboards, contributing to more meaningful decision-making processes. © 2021 by the authors.

      <abstract>The UAE has officially launched the Big Data initiative in the year 2022; however, the interest in and adoption of Big Data technologies and strategies had started much earlier in the private and public sectors. This research aims to explore the perceptions of the UAE employees on factors needed to implement sustainable Big Data and the continuous impact on their organizational performance. A total of 257 employees were randomly selected for an online survey, and data were collected using a Likert-style five-point scale that was tested for validity and reliability. The findings indicate that employees believe that Big Data Sustainable Implementation leads to Business Performance. Additionally, employees consider factors such as Big Data Architecture Quality, Human Cognitive Factors, and Organizational Readiness to significantly impact on Sustainable Implementation. Further, a moderating impact of Human Cognitive Factors was found on the relationship between Big Data Architecture Quality and Sustainable Implementation. The study provides managerial insights and recommendations for policymaking. © 2022 by the author.</abstract>

      <abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that creative leadership based on data and citizen volunteers is more significant than vaccines themselves, so this study focuses on the collaboration of sophisticated technologies and human potential to monitor air pollution. Air pollution contributes to critical environmental problems in various towns and cities. With the emergence of the smart city concept, appropriate methods to curb exposure to pollutants must be part of an appropriate urban development policy. This study presents a technologically driven air quality solution for smart cities that advertises energy-efficient and cleaner sequestration in these areas. It attempts to explore how to incorporate data-driven approaches and citizen participation into effective public sector pollution management in smart cities as a major component of the smart city definition. The smart city idea was developed as cities became more widespread through communication devices. This study addresses the technical criteria for implementing a framework that public administration can use to prepare for renovation of public buildings, minimizing energy use and costs and linking smart police stations to monitor air pollution as a part of an integrated city. Such a digital transition in resource management will increase public governance energy performance and provide a higher standard for operations and a healthier environment. The study results indicate that complex processes lead to efficient and sustainable smart cities. This research discovered an interpretive pattern in how public agencies, private enterprises, and community members think and what they do in these regional contexts. It concludes that economic and social benefits could be realized by exploiting data-driven smart city development for its social and spatial complexities. © 2021 by the authors.

      <abstract>With the proliferation of e-procurement systems in the public sector,
valuable and open information sources can be jointly accessed. Our
research aims to explore different legal Open Data; in particular, we
explored the data set of the National Anti-Corruption Authority in Italy
on public procurement and the judges&#39; sentences related to public
procurement, published on the website of the Italian Administrative
Justice from 2007 to 2022. Our first goal was to train machine learning
models capable of automatically recognizing which procurement has led to
disputes and consequently complaints to the Administrative Justice,
identifying the relevant features of procurement that correspond to
certain anomalies. Our second goal was to develop a recommender system
on procurement to return similar procurement to a given one and find
companies for bidders, depending on the procurement requirements.(c)

      <abstract>The advent of connected devices, such as smartphones, has had a transformative impact on the landscape of recent years. Once privacy concerns have been addressed, data can be handled and analysed in a proficient manner to gain insights into patterns and movements, thereby influencing urban policies. It is likely that mobility and transport-related topics have been the subject of the most extensive investigation in the field of cell phone big data. While the topic of commuting patterns has been extensively researched by numerous authors, there is a paucity of literature on the monitoring of attendance during major motorsport events. Despite the predictability of crowding (tickets are sold in advance and the schedule is fixed and rigid), multiday motorsport events are disruptive in terms of traffic, overcrowding and uneasiness for hosting cities. This paper aims to address the aforementioned gap by presenting a case study of monitoring attendance during the Formula One Emilia-Romagna and Made in Italy Grand Prix, held in Imola, Italy, from 22nd to 24th April 2022. The results demonstrated the potential of data to inform the prediction of mobility choices and the planning of appropriate mobility-related policies, with the aim of reducing the impact of future events. This represents a significant challenge for public administrations and stakeholders. © 2024 World Conference on Transport Research Society</abstract>

      <abstract>In many Arab countries&#39; public administrations, Arabic personal names are written with Latin alphabet, generally, in various ways by different writers. This has led to many problems when it comes to connecting these administrations. The aim of this study was to propose two new approaches for the pairwise matching of Arabic personal names. The first approach is based on string alignment and phonetic transcription. Appropriate scoring functions were defined to catch similarity between Arabic personal names. In the second approach, we use machine learning techniques to derive a suitable model for this problem. Precisely, we suggest using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture and experiment with different configurations. Performances of the new models compare well with the best-performing similarity measures (Jaro, Jaro-Winkler, Double Metaphone and Edit Distance) in terms of precision, recall and F1. Even though the work was carried out for the (Algeria&#x2F;French Alphabet) case, it can be adapted to any other (country&#x2F;script) case, like (Egypt&#x2F;English). © 2021 Attia Nehar, Slimane Bellaouar, Djelloul Ziadi and Khaled Moulay Omar.

      <abstract>Despite the enormous potential of artificial intelligence (AI), many
public organizations struggle to adopt this technology. Simultaneously,
empirical research on what determines successful AI adoption in public
settings remains scarce. Using the technology organization environment
(TOE) framework, we address this gap with a comparative case study of
eight Swiss public organizations. Our findings suggest that the
importance of technological and organizational factors varies depending
on the organization&#39;s stage in the adoption process, whereas
environmental factors are generally less critical. Accordingly, this
study advances our theoretical understanding of the specificities of AI
adoption in public organizations throughout the different adoption
stages.</abstract>

      <abstract>Scholarship on evidence-based policy, a subset of the policy analysis
literature, largely assumes information is produced and consumed by
humans. However, due to the expansion of artificial intelligence in the
public sector, debates no longer capture the full range concerns. Here,
we derive a typology of arguments on evidence-based policy that performs
two functions: taken separately, the categories serve as directions in
which debates may proceed, in light of advances in technology; taken
together, the categories act as a set of frames through which the use of
evidence in policy making might be understood. Using a case of welfare
fraud detection in the Netherlands, we show how the acknowledgement of
divergent frames can enable a holistic analysis of evidence use in
policy making that considers the ethical issues inherent in automated
data processing. We argue that such an analysis will enhance the
real-world relevance of the evidence-based policy paradigm.</abstract>

      <abstract>Bureaucracies are often criticized for their inflexibility, budget-maximizing wastefulness, and excessive rules and procedures. Rapid advances in technology, including the expansion of digital government, the use of artificial intelligence, and the ability to collect and analyze big data, promise to make public sector organizations leaner, more efficient, and more responsive to citizens&#39; needs. While these technological changes have prompted some observers to forecast the end of bureaucracy, data from many countries show that bureaucratic public organizations are not disappearing. In this article, we argue that this paradox can be explained by revisiting some of the foundational work of sociologist Max Weber, who envisioned public administration itself as a bureaucratic machine. Advanced computing technologies, like artificial intelligence, are reinforcing bureaucratic tendencies in the public sector, not eliminating them. While advances in technology may transform the way public sector organizations operate, they can also serve to strengthen bureaucracy&#39;s core purpose. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>In the new economy, strategic alliances enable business to gain competitive advantages through access to partner&#39;s resources, including markets, technologies, capital and people. In the context of the provision of the Electricity Act in 2003 has allowed a dynamic competitive growth of public sector and private sector in Indian electricity market, it becomes critical for Indian electricity firms to enter strategic alliance to improve business performance and competitive advantages by seeking right partners that augment strengths or ameliorate weaknesses. Over the 5-year time frame in the past to have 4-year forecasting, this paper tries to suggest a new approach of integrated GM (1,1), neural network and DEA model in order to assist Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation in selecting its right strategic alliance partner. The results indicate that Power Grid Corporation and Reliance Infrastructure are the very best candidates for Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation to form strategic alliances. The findings are not only good for the target company but also beneficial for the partners. Furthermore, the proposed method allows upper management to properly adjust input and output factors for industry, based on their calculations for reference purposes. © 2017 Research Information Ltd.

      <abstract>Public crises can bring unprecedented damage to the tourism industry and challenges to tourism demand forecasting, which is essential for crisis management and sustainable development. Existing studies mainly focused on point forecasts, but point forecasts may not be enough for the uncertain environments of public crises. This study proposes a combined Bayesian interval tourism demand forecasting model based on a forgetting curve. Moreover, considering tourists’ travel plans may be adjusted due to changing crisis situations, the choice of search engine data for forecasting tourism demand is investigated and incorporated into the proposed model to yield reliable results. Through an empirical study, this study figures out that the Baidu Index had better tourism predictive capabilities before the public crisis, whereas the Google Index effectively captured short-term fluctuations of tourism demand within the crisis period. The results also indicate that integrating both Baidu and Google Index data obtains the best prediction performance after the crisis outbreak. Our main contribution is that this study can generate flexible forecasting results in the interval form, which can effectively handle uncertainties in practice and formulate control measures for practitioners. Another novelty is successfully discovering how to select appropriate search engine data to improve the performance of tourism demand forecasts across different stages of a public crisis, thus benefiting daily operations and crisis management in the tourism sector. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Digital technologies currently have a significant impact on most areas
of society, including the sphere of state and municipal government. The
most popular and in demand today are the forms and mechanisms of social
control over the activities of government bodies using digital
technologies. The article examines the theoretical, legal, and empirical
aspects of social control in the public administration system in the
context of digitalization. Toward the active development of the digital
society, the issues of digitalization are gaining more and more
popularity in the modern world, including the improvement of the
activities of public authorities using advanced digital technologies,
artificial intelligence, information, and telecommunication systems. The
article analyzes the regulatory, financial, personnel, organizational,
and managerial aspects of effective social control in the public
administration system based on sociological surveys and experts&#39;
interviews, and offers practical digital solutions to improve the
effectiveness of social control. The digital software project of the
&#x60;&#x60;Open Government&#39;&#39; is proposed, which is aimed at increasing the
efficiency of interaction between public authorities and the population,
representatives of the business environment, and the public. This work
concludes and recommends improving social control over the activities of
the authorities in the context of digitalization.</abstract>

      <abstract>A chatbot is emerged as an effective tool to address the user queries in
automated, most appropriate and accurate way. Depending upon the
complexity of the subject domain, researchers are employing variety of
soft-computing techniques to make the chatbot user-friendly. It is
observed that chatbots have flooded the globe with wide range of
services including ordering foods, suggesting products, advising for
insurance policies, providing customer support, giving financial
assistance, schedule meetings etc. However, public administration based
services wherein chatbot intervention influence the most, is not
explored yet. This paper discuses about artificial intelligence based
chatbots including their applications, challenges, architecture and
models. It also talks about evolution of chatbots starting from Turing
Test and Rule-based chatbots to advanced Artificial Intelligence based
Chatbots (AI-Chatbots). AI-Chatbots are providing much kind of services,
which this paper outlines into two main aspects including customer based
services and public administration based services. The purpose of this
survey is to understand and explore the possibility of customer &amp;
public administration services based chatbot. The survey demonstrates
that there exist an immense potential in the AI assisted chatbot system
for providing customer services and providing better governance in
public administration services.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) poses a set of interwoven challenges. A new
general purpose technology likened to steam power or electricity, AI
must first be clearly defined before considering its global governance.
In this context, a useful definition is technology that uses advanced
computation to perform at human cognitive capacity in some task area.
Like electricity, AI cannot be governed in isolation, but in the context
of a broader digital technology toolbox. Establishing national and
community priorities on how to reap AI&#39;s benefits, while managing its
social and economic risks, will be an evolving debate. A fundamental
driver of the development and deployment of AI tools, of the algorithms
and data, are the dominant Digital Platform Firms (DPFs). Unless
specifically regulated, DPF&#39;s set de facto rules for use of data and
algorithms. That can shift the borderline between public and private,
and result in priorities that differ from those of the public sector or
civil society. Governance of AI and the toolbox is a critical component
of national success in the coming decades, as governments recognize
opportunities and geopolitical risks posed by the suite of technologies.
However, AI pries open a Pandora&#39;s box of questions that sweep across
the economy and society engaging diverse communities. Rather than strive
towards global agreement on a single set of market and social rules, one
must consider how to pursue objectives of interoperability amongst
nations with quite different political economies. Even such limited
agreements are complicated following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online and hybrid (online plus on-campus) learning has increased significantly in the twenty-first century. One Midwestern university started offering more hybrid courses in 2005 in its Master in Public Administration program. The author conducted student surveys to assess the preferences of adult learners for the different modes of instruction, their perceptions of each process, and their perceptions of each mode’s learning outcomes. Analysis of survey responses indicates that the majority of adult learners value the flexibility of online learning while still desiring on-campus sessions for interaction with other students and the professor, which students believe improves learning outcomes. Significantly, students believe that the combination of on-campus and online classes adds overall value to aspects of their learning experience. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>

      <abstract>Decisions where there is not enough information for a well-informed
decision due to unidentified consequences, options, or undetermined
demarcation of the decision problem are called decisions under great
uncertainty. This paper argues that public policy decisions on how and
if to implement decision-making processes based on machine learning and
AI for public use are such decisions. Decisions on public policy on AI
are uncertain due to three features specific to the current landscape of
AI, namely (i) the vagueness of the definition of AI, (ii) uncertain
outcomes of AI implementations and (iii) pacing problems. Given that
many potential applications of AI in the public sector concern functions
central to the public sphere, decisions on the implementation of such
applications are particularly sensitive. Therefore, it is suggested that
public policy-makers and decision-makers in the public sector can adopt
strategies from the argumentative approach in decision theory to
mitigate the established great uncertainty. In particular, the notions
of framing and temporal strategies are considered.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: This article revisits some theories and concepts of public administration, including those related to public value, transaction costs and social equity, to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in public service delivery. The author seeks to mobilize theory to guide AI-era public management practitioners and researchers. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: The author uses an existing task classification model to mobilize and juxtapose public management theories against artificial intelligence potential impacts in public service delivery. Theories of social equity and transaction costs as well as some concepts such as red tape, efficiency and economy are used to argue that the discipline of public administration provides a foundation to ensure algorithms are used in a way that improves service delivery. Findings: After presenting literature on the challenges and promises of using AI in public service, the study shows that while the adoption of algorithms in public service has benefits, some serious challenges still exist when looked at under the lenses of theory. Additionally, the author mobilizes the public administration concepts of agenda setting and coproduction and finds that designing AI-enabled public services should be centered on citizens who are not mere customers. As an implication for public management practice, this study shows that bringing citizens to the forefront of designing and implementing AI-delivered services is key to reducing the reproduction of social biases. Research limitations&#x2F;implications: As a fast-growing subject, artificial intelligence research in public management is yet to empirically test some of the theories that the study presented. Practical implications: The paper vulgarizes some theories of public administration which practitioners can consider in the design and implementation of AI-enabled public services. Additionally, the study shows practitioners that bringing citizens to the forefront of designing and implementing AI-delivered services is key to reducing the reproduction of social biases. Social implications: The paper informs a broad audience who might not be familiar with public administration theories and how those theories can be taken into consideration when adopting AI systems in service delivery. Originality&#x2F;value: This research is original, as, to the best of the author’s knowledge, no prior work has combined these concepts in analyzing AI in the public sector. © 2023, Stany Nzobonimpa.</abstract>

      <abstract>Across the world, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are being
more widely employed in public sector decision-making and processes as a
supposedly neutral and an efficient method for optimizing delivery of
services. However, the deployment of these technologies has also
prompted investigation into the potentially unanticipated consequences
of their introduction, to both positive and negative ends. This paper
chooses to focus specifically on the relationship between gender bias
and AI, exploring claims of the neutrality of such technologies and how
its understanding of bias could influence policy and outcomes. Building
on a rich seam of literature from both technological and sociological
fields, this article constructs an original framework through which to
analyse both the perpetuation and mitigation of gender biases, choosing
to categorize AI technologies based on whether their input is text or
images. Through the close analysis and pairing of four case studies, the
paper thus unites two often disparate approaches to the investigation of
bias in technology, revealing the large and varied potential for AI to
echo and even amplify existing human bias, while acknowledging the
important role AI itself can play in reducing or reversing these
effects. The conclusion calls for further collaboration between scholars
from the worlds of technology, gender studies and public policy in fully
exploring algorithmic accountability as well as in accurately and
transparently exploring the potential consequences of the introduction
of AI technologies.</abstract>

      <abstract>The banking sector in India plays a crucial role in economic growth. A bank provides an opportunity for investments to encourage economic growth and the potential to yield higher returns. In this study, we develop a bankruptcy prediction model by using machine learning (ML) techniques, namely logistic regression, random forest, and AdaBoost, and compare these models with those developed using deep learning (DL) techniques, namely the artificial neural network (ANN). ANN results in the highest accuracy and the most favourable prediction model for bankruptcy. Data used in this study are collected from survived and failed private and public sector banks from India from March 2001 to March 2018. For bankruptcy prediction, we use the bank’s macroeconomic and market structure-related features. The feature selection technique ‘Relief algorithm’ is used to select useful features for the bankruptcy prediction model. Because failed banks in comparison with survived were less in the dataset, the issue of imbalanced cases may have arisen, in which case most ML and DL techniques do not perform well. Thus, we convert the dataset into a balanced form by using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The results of this study can help in performing financial analyses of banks and thus have significant implications for their stakeholders. © 2023, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

      <abstract>Objective: To assess the relationship between remote digital monitoring (RDM) modalities for diabetes and intrusiveness in patients’ lives. Patients and Methods: Online vignette-based survey (February 1 through July 1, 2019). Adults with diabetes (type 1, 2, or subtypes such as latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood) assessed three randomly selected vignettes among 36 that combined different modalities for monitoring tools (three options: glucose- and physical activity [PA]–monitoring only, or glucose- and PA-monitoring with occasional or regular food monitoring), duration&#x2F;feedback loops (six options: monitoring for a week before all vs before specific consultations with feedback given in consultation, vs monitoring permanently, with real-time feedback by one&#39;s physician vs by anoter caregiver, vs monitoring permanently, with real-time, artificial intelligence-generated treatment feedback vs treatment and lifestyle feedback), and data handling (two options: by the public vs private sector). We compared intrusiveness (assessed on a 5-point scale) across vignettes and used linear mixed models to identify intrusiveness determinants. We collected qualitative data to identify aspects that drove participants’ perception of intrusiveness. Results: Overall, 1010 participants from 30 countries provided 2860 vignette-assessments (52% were type 1 diabetes). The monitoring modalities associated with increased intrusiveness were food monitoring compared with glucose- and PA-monitoring alone (β&#x3D;0.34; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.42; P&lt;.001) and permanent monitoring with real-time physician-generated feedback compared with monitoring for a week with feedback in consultation (β&#x3D;0.25; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.34, P&lt;.001). Public-sector data handling was associated with decreased intrusiveness as compared with private-sector (β&#x3D;−0.15; 95% CI, −0.22 to −0.09; P&lt;.001). Four drivers of intrusiveness emerged from the qualitative analysis: practical&#x2F;psychosocial burden (eg, RDM attracting attention in public), control, data safety&#x2F;misuse, and dehumanization of care. Conclusion: RDM is intrusive when it includes food monitoring, real-time human feedback, and private-sector data handling. © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: Despite several big data maturity models developed for businesses, assessment of big data maturity in the public sector is an under-explored yet important area. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to identify the big data maturity models developed specifically for the public sector and evaluate two major big data maturity models in that respect: one at the state level and the other at the organizational level. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: A literature search is conducted using Web of Science and Google Scholar to determine big data maturity models explicitly addressing big data adoption by governments, and then two major models are identified and compared: Klievink et al.’s Big Data maturity model and Kuraeva’s Big Data maturity model. Findings: While Klievink et al.’s model is designed to evaluate Big Data maturity at the organizational level, Kuraeva’s model is appropriate for assessments at the state level. The first model sheds light on the micro-level factors considering the specific data collection routines and requirements of the public organizations, whereas the second one provides a general framework in terms of the conditions necessary for government’s big data maturity such as legislative framework and national policy dimensions (strategic plans and actions). Originality&#x2F;value: This study contributes to the literature by identifying and evaluating the models specifically designed to assess big data maturity in the public sector. Based on the review, it provides insights about the development of integrated models to evaluate big data maturity in the public sector. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public sector organizations (city authorities) have begun to explore ways to exploit big data to provide smarter solutions for cities. The way organizations learn to use new forms of technology has been widely researched. However, many public sector organisations have found themselves in new territory in trying to deploy and integrate this new form of technology (big data) to another fast moving and relatively new concept (smart city). This paper is a cross-sectional scoping study—from two UK smart city initiatives—on the learning processes experienced by elite (top management) stakeholders in the advent and adoption of these two novel concepts. The findings are an experiential narrative account on learning to exploit big data to address issues by developing solutions through smart city initiatives. The findings revealed a set of moves in relation to the exploration and exploitation of big data through smart city initiatives: (a) knowledge finding; (b) knowledge reframing; (c) inter-organization collaborations and (d) ex-post evaluations. Even though this is a time-sensitive scoping study it gives an account on a current state-of-play on the use of big data in public sector organizations for creating smarter cities. This study has implications for practitioners in the smart city domain and contributes to academia by operationalizing and adapting Crossan et al’s (Acad Manag Rev 24(3): 522–537, 1999) 4I model on organizational learning. © 2017, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>What information should and can be transparent for artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms? This article examines the socio- technical and legal perspectives of transparency in relation to algorithmic decision-making in public administration. We show how transparency in AI can be understood in light of the various technologies and the challenges one may encounter. Despite some first steps in that direction, there exists so far no mature standard for documenting AI models. From a legal perspective, this article examined the applicable freedom of information (FOI) regimes across different jurisdictions, with a particular focus on Denmark and other Scandinavian countries. Despite notable differences, our findings show that the FOI regimes generally only grant access to existing documents, and that access can be denied on the basis of the wide proprietary interests and internal documents exemptions. This is why we ultimately conclude that the European data-protection framework and the proposed EU AI Act -with their far-reaching duties to document the functioning of AI systems -provide promising new avenues for research and insights into transparency in AI.

      <abstract>The new coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis has had a devastating impact across the world. Public administration discipline addresses emergency crisis management in various ways and dimensions. This article seeks answers to the question: “How can AI contribute to crisis management policies to fight against COVID-19 and its impacts?” To this, the techniques and methods of AI in fighting against the COVID-19 virus will be explained in various dimensions. AI can make significant contributions in the preparation, mitigation-prevention, response, and recovery policies in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. If adopted, AI can be used to find better treatment routes and drug development. Equally, policymakers can benefit from AI as decision support to reach high-quality decisions through fast and accurate data. The paper concludes that governments should create and implement effective AI-based crisis management strategies to fight against the epidemic locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally with a multi-level governance perspective. © 2021 IGI Global.

      <abstract>Although governments are investing heavily in big data analytics,
reports show mixed results in terms of performance. Whilst big data
analytics capability provided a valuable lens in business and seems
useful for the public sector, there is little knowledge of its
relationship with governmental performance. This study aims to explain
how big data analytics capability led to governmental performance. Using
a survey research methodology, an integrated conceptual model is
proposed highlighting a comprehensive set of big data analytics
resources influencing governmental performance. The conceptual model was
developed based on prior literature. Using a PLS-SEM approach, the
results strongly support the posited hypotheses. Big data analytics
capability has a strong impact on governmental efficiency,
effectiveness, and fairness. The findings of this paper confirmed the
imperative role of big data analytics capability in governmental
performance in the public sector, which earlier studies found in the
private sector. This study also validated measures of governmental
performance.</abstract>

      <abstract>The use of inclusive language, among many other gender equality
initiatives in society, has garnered great attention in recent years.
Gender equality offices in universities and public administration cannot
cope with the task of manually checking the use of non-inclusive
language in the documentation that those institutions generate. In this
research, an automated solution for the detection of non-inclusive uses
of the Spanish language in doctoral theses generated in Spanish
universities is introduced using machine learning techniques. A large
dataset has been used to train, validate, and analyze the use of
inclusive language; the result is an algorithm that detects, within any
Spanish text document, non-inclusive uses of the language with error,
false positive, and false negative ratios slightly over 10%, and
precision, recall, and F-measure percentages over 86%. Results also
show the evolution with time of the ratio of non-inclusive usages per
document, having a pronounced reduction in the last years under study.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown significantly in popularity, accompanied by increased capacity and lower cost of communications, and overwhelming development of technologies. At the same time, big data and real-time data analysis have taken on great importance and have been accompanied by unprecedented interest in sharing data among citizens, public administrations and other organisms, giving rise to what is known as the Collaborative Internet of Things. This growth in data and infrastructure must be accompanied by a software architecture that allows its exploitation. Although there are various proposals focused on the exploitation of the IoT at edge, fog and&#x2F;or cloud levels, it is not easy to find a software solution that exploits the three tiers together, taking maximum advantage not only of the analysis of contextual and situational data at each tier, but also of two-way communications between adjacent ones. In this paper, we propose an architecture that solves these deficiencies by proposing novel technologies which are appropriate for managing the resources of each tier: edge, fog and cloud. In addition, the fact that two-way communications along the three tiers of the architecture is allowed considerably enriches the contextual and situational information in each layer, and substantially assists decision making in real time. The paper illustrates the proposed software architecture through a case study of respiratory disease surveillance in hospitals. As a result, the proposed architecture permits efficient communications between the different tiers responding to the needs of these types of IoT scenarios. © 2021 The Author(s)</abstract>

      <abstract>Nowadays, European program Copernicus&#39; Sentinel missions have allowed
the development of several application services. In this regard, to
strengthen the use of free satellite data in ordinary administrative
workflows, this work aims to evaluate the feasibility and prototypal
development of a possible service called Sen4MUN for the distribution of
contributions yearly allocated to local municipalities and scalable to
all European regions. The analysis was focused on the Aosta Valley
region, North West Italy. A comparison between the Ordinary Workflow
(OW) and the suggested Sen4MUN approach was performed. OW is based on
statistical survey and municipality declaration, while Sen4MUN is based
on geospatial deep learning techniques on aerial imagery (to extract
roads and buildings to get real estate units) and yearly Land Cover map
components according to European EAGLE guidelines. Both methods are
based on land cover components which represent the input on which the
financial coefficients for assigning contributions are applied. In both
approaches, buffers are applied onto urban class (LCb). This buffer was
performed according to the EEA-ISPRA soil consumption guidelines to
avoid underestimating some areas that are difficult to map. In the case
of Sen4MUN, this is applied to overcome Sentinel sensor limits and
spectral mixing issues, while in the case of OW, this is due to limits
in the survey method itself. Finally, a validation was performed
assuming as truth the approach defined by law as the standard, i.e., OW,
although it has limitations. MAEs involving LCb, road lengths and real
estate units demonstrate the effectiveness of Sen4MUN. The developed
approach suggests a contribution system based on Geomatics and Remote
sensing to the public administration.</abstract>

      <abstract>As is common across the public sector, the UK police service is under pressure to do more with less, to target resources more efficiently and take steps to identify threats proactively; for example under riskassessment schemes such as ‘Clare’s Law’ and ‘Sarah’s Law’. Algorithmic tools promise to improve a police force’s decisionmaking and prediction abilities by making better use of data (including intelligence), both from inside and outside the force. This article uses Durham Constabulary’s Harm Assessment Risk Tool (HART) as a case-study. HART is one of the first algorithmic models to be deployed by a UK police force in an operational capacity. Our article comments upon the potential benefits of such tools, explains the concept and method of HART and considers the results of the first validation of the model’s use and accuracy. The article then critiques the use of algorithmic tools within policing from a societal and legal perspective, focusing in particular upon substantive common law grounds for judicial review. It considers a concept of ‘experimental’ proportionality to permit the use of unproven algorithms in the public sector in a controlled and time-limited way, and as part of a combination of approaches to combat algorithmic opacity, proposes ‘ALGO-CARE’, a guidance framework of some of the key legal and practical concerns that should be considered in relation to the use of algorithmic risk assessment tools by the police. The article concludes that for the use of algorithmic tools in a policing context to result in a ‘better’ outcome, that is to say, a more efficient use of police resources in a landscape of more consistent, evidence-based decision-making, then an ‘experimental’ proportionality approach should be developed to ensure that new solutions from ‘big data’ can be found for criminal justice problems traditionally arising from clouded, non-augmented decision-making. Finally, this article notes that there is a sub-set of decisions around which there is too great an impact upon society and upon the welfare of individuals for them to be influenced by an emerging technology; to an extent, in fact, that they should be removed from the influence of algorithmic decision-making altogether. © 2018 The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>On April 25, 2018, the European Commission (EC) published a series of communications related to data trading and artificial intelligence. One of them called &quot;Towards a Common European Data Space&quot;, came with a working document: &quot;Guidance on Sharing Private Sector Data in the European Data Economy&quot;. Both the Communication and the guidance introduce two different sets of general principles addressing data sharing, contractual best practices for business-To-business (B2B), and business-To-government (B2G) environments. On the same day, the EC also published a legislative proposal to review the Public Sector (PSI) Directive. These two simultaneous actions are part of a major package of measures, which aim to facilitate the creation of a common data space in the EU and foster European artificial intelligence development. This article focuses on the first action, the &quot;Guidance on Sharing Private Sector Data in the European Economy&quot;. First, because it is one of its kind. Second, although these principles do not qualify as soft law (lacking binding force but having legal effects) the Commission&#39;s communications set action plans for future legislation. Third, because the ultimate goal of these principles is to boost European artificial intelligence (AI) development. However, do these principles set a viable legal framework for data sharing, or is this public policy tool merely a naïve expectation? Moreover, would these principles set a successful path toward a thriving European AI advancement? In this contribution, I try to sketch some answers to these and related questions. © 2019 Begoña Gonzalez Otero.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study aims to identify the causes of delays in public construction projects in Thailand, a developing country. Increasing construction durations lead to higher costs, making it essential to pinpoint the causes of these delays. The research analyzed 30 public construction projects that encountered delays. Delay causes were categorized into four groups: contractor-related, client-related, supervisor-related, and external factors. A questionnaire was used to survey these causes, and the Relative Importance Index (RII) method was employed to prioritize them. The findings revealed that the primary cause of delays was contractor-related financial issues, such as cash flow problems, with an RII of 0.777 and a weighted value of 84.44%. The second most significant cause was labor issues, such as a shortage of workers during the harvest season or festivals, with an RII of 0.773. Additionally, various algorithms were used to compare the Relative Importance Index (RII) and four machine learning methods: Decision Tree (DT), Deep Learning, Neural Network, and Naïve Bayes. The Deep Learning model proved to be the most effective baseline model, achieving a 90.79% accuracy rate in identifying contractor-related financial issues as a cause of construction delays. This was followed by the Neural Network model, which had an accuracy rate of 90.26%. The Decision Tree model had an accuracy rate of 85.26%. The RII values ranged from 68.68% for the Naïve Bayes model to 77.70% for the highest RII model. The research results indicate that contractor financial liquidity and costs significantly impact construction operations, which public agencies must consider. Additionally, the availability of contractor labor is crucial for the continuity of projects. The accuracy and reliability of the data obtained using advanced data mining techniques demonstrate the effectiveness of these results. This can be efficiently utilized by stakeholders involved in construction projects in Thailand to enhance construction project management. © 2024 by author(s).

      <abstract>The presented study examines the epistemological and philosophical and
legal problems of the introduction of artificial intelligence systems in
law enforcement. The article discusses the problematic implementation
and use of artificial intelligence to automate the enforcement process,
the judiciary and public administration. It is shown that the latter is
considered without taking into account a key factor - the specifics of
the intellectual process of bringing the general norm to a particular
case. The authors show that for artificial intelligence systems, the
contextuality of the principles of law is not achievable, while it is
extremely necessary in law enforcement. In Al, contextual intellectual
procedures cannot be programmed, since the ratio between the norm and
the context of its interpretation involves a break through the
hermeneutic circle in which the norm is a part and the context of the
norm (industry principles) is a whole. The limited possibilities of
using artificial intelligence systems in justice are also discussed, it
is proved that digitalization in this area will be only instrumental in
nature, and the administrative functions of robotic technologies are
quite problematic and generally ineffective in the spiritual, moral and
ethical dimension.</abstract>

      <abstract>The growth and expansion of &#x60;&#x60;Big Data&#39;&#39; is fundamentally changing
public service delivery. Big Data is getting &#x60;&#x60;bigger,&#39;&#39; and public
organizations will have new opportunities to cultivate and challenges to
address. To understand the effects of the growth of data on public
organizations, we introduce the Public Data Primacy (PDP) theoretical
framework, which builds on existing scholarship through four
propositions about data, technology, and its use in the public sector.
The framework posits that public sector work will become increasingly
data-centric as data continues to get &#x60;&#x60;bigger.&#39;&#39; Ultimately, the PDP
leads to two predictions about the public sector. First, we predict that
the primacy of data in the delivery of public services is inevitable.
Second, this forthcoming reality will require public servants to adopt
new models of public service oriented around data. The PDP theoretical
framework provides a systematic lens in which public administration
scholarship can evaluate the future of data growth and its impacts upon
public service delivery.</abstract>

      <abstract>Mass adoption of advanced information technologies is fueling a need for public servants with the skills to manage data-driven public agencies. Public employees typically acquire data skills through graduate research methods courses, which focus primarily on research design and statistical analysis. What data skills are currently taught, and what content should Master of Public Administration (MPA) programs include in their research method courses? We categorized research method course content in 52 syllabi from 31 MPA programs to understand how data skills are taught in public administration. We find that most graduate programs rely on research methods more suited for academic and policy research while lacking the data skills needed to modernize public agencies. Informed by these results, this work presents the Data Science Literacy Framework as a guide for assessing and planning curriculum within MPA programs. © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public administration is struggling to contend with a substantial shift in practice fueled by the accelerating adoption of information technology. New skills, competencies and pedagogies are required by the field to help overcome the data-skills gap. As a means to address these deficiencies, we introduce the Data Science Literacy Framework, a heuristic for incorporating data science principles into public administration programs. The framework suggests that data literacy is the dominant principle underlying a shift in professional practice, accentuated by an understanding of computational science, statistical methodology, and data-adjacent domain knowledge. A combination of new and existing skills meshed into public administration curriculums help implement these principles and advance public administration education. © The Author(s) 2021.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence development and research leaders in business,
industry, and nations gain a major competitive edge. Additionally, it is
clear that nations with a well-established national artificial
intelligence policy have an edge over others, both technologically and
economically. To further their artificial intelligence capability,
nations also seek to develop a strategy, vision, structure, and working
environment that encourages collaboration between the public sector,
private industry, and educational institutions. Artificial intelligence
is thought to be a tool that will help bridge the gap between powerful
and developing countries growing in the future. Using data from &#x60;&#x60;The
Global AI Index&#39;&#39; for 2021, this study aims to examine and analyze the
present state of artificial intelligence management in 62 nations in
terms of talent, infrastructure, business environment, development and
research government policy, and commercial efforts. The research used
PROMETHEE, which is widely used in multi-criteria decision-making
evaluations, and its geometric representation, the GAIA plane. This
study also found that the United States of America is the world leader
in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development as well as AI
investment. The United Kingdom, China, Israel, Canada, the Netherlands,
South Korea, and Germany all rank well. China is rapidly catching up to
the USA. At the very bottom of the list are nations such as Armenia,
Kenya, Egypt, South Africa, and Pakistan. Turkey&#39;s values are more
similar to those of nations towards the bottom of the list than of those
in the top half. There is a significant gap between the top three
countries and the rest of the world in all parameters included in the
survey. Except for the &#x60;State Strategy&#39; category, Turkey scores quite
low compared to the top-performing countries. Decision makers are
expected to address the identified global challenges of the study by
creating a more comprehensive national AI strategy, both financially and
in terms of content.</abstract>

      <abstract>The analysis focused on how efficient management of the national data asset is supported by the Hungarian regulatory framework concerning the use of public information, and whether public data constituting part of the national data asset can be deemed authentic and reliable to support the efforts for the digitalisation and artificial intelligence-based developments of the public sector. The analysis shows why the availability of authentic and reliable data in terms of the national data asset has outstanding significance. In support of this assertion, it presents the different levels of data asset use, the role of using artificial intelligence in the public sector, and the significance, risks and challenges of the authenticity and reliability of public data, from both a data protection and a public finance aspect. Inaccuracy, unreliability of input data predestines the generation of incorrect result products (conclusion, decision), even if the appropriate algorithm is used, which could lead to direct financial loss, for both the citizens and the state. The authors of the analysis therefore suggest that a paradigm shift is necessary in the strategies targeting the efficient use of the public sector&#39;s data, with the necessity to record the fundamental precondition that the national data asset must be based on reliable and authentic data. © 2021 Brepols Publishers.

      <abstract>In the past few years, several democratic governments have published their National AI Strategies (NASs). These documents outline how AI technology should be implemented in the public sector and explain the policies that will ensure the ethical use of personal data. In this article, I examine these documents as political texts and reconstruct the political imaginary that underlies them. I argue that these documents intervene in contemporary democratic politics by suggesting that AI can help democracies overcome some of the challenges they are facing. To achieve this, NASs use different kinds of imaginaries—democratic, sociotechnical and data—that help citizens envision how a future AI democracy might look like. As part of this collective effort, a new kind of relationship between citizens and governments is formed. Citizens are seen as autonomous data subjects, but at the same time, they are expected to share their personal data for the common good. As a result, I argue, a new kind of political imaginary is developed in these documents. One that maintains a human-centric approach while championing a vision of collective sovereignty over data. This kind of political imaginary can become useful in understanding the roles of citizens and governments in this technological age. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>The contribution of the paper is the building of a model to predict the
proper employees&#39; allocation in the Greek public sector. To acknowledge
the set and weights of criteria upon which our model feeds data, a
validated questionnaire was developed and used to conduct a primary
quantitative survey amongst HR departments and employees of state
organizations in Greece. On the acquired findings, several experiments
were administered using linear and machine learning tools, aiming to
replace time consuming and subjective procedures, followed by many
organizations. Concluding, data classification algorithms are proposed
to predict the best matching of employees, giving as inputs personnel
qualifications as well as job specifications, leading to a model based
on J48, a decision tree algorithm.</abstract>

      <abstract>Administration is aiming to control the performance of human resources in order to achieve its best possible exploitation and through it resources economy that is an important issue for all organisations. Innovations about human resource evaluation systems, is a success factor of all administrative changes. Management of human resources is based on proper selection and positioning of the staffs that add value to an organisation. Artificial intelligence is the new ally for managers, but it is not wide-spread in the public sector. In this study, we collected and assessed personnel&#39;s data in a public organisation and by using various classification algorithms, specific models were built according to job description and employees&#39; qualifications. Our scope is the development of an innovative framework, using machine learning techniques for meritocratic personnel selection for recruitment and simultaneously, positioning either horizontally in the departments or vertically in leadership positions, unifying three procedures in one. © 2021 Inderscience Publishers.

      <abstract>PurposeThis paper aims to investigate whether the implementation of
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) impacts government
functionality. The study will analyse GAI&#39;s positive attributes across
different dimensions to comprehensively understand its value proposition
for public organisations. Furthermore, the paper will outline the
strategic interventions required to integrate GAI effectively within the
organisational context of government
transformation.Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approachThis study measures
&#x60;&#x60;government functionality&#39;&#39; and &#x60;&#x60;GAI implementation&#39;&#39; using
abstract macro variables as a second-order formative model. It also
includes first-order measurable micro-variables to better understand the
concept. In addition, the study introduces &#x60;&#x60;organisational context&#39;&#39;
as a moderating factor to explain the complex dynamics of integrating
GAI to improve government functionality. The study proposes a conceptual
framework, which was analysed using exploratory data analysis, with
primary data collected through questionnaires.FindingsThe study finds a
positive correlation between the implementation of GAI and improved
government functionality. Furthermore, it found that organisational
contextualisation significantly moderates this relationship. All the
empirical outcomes align with the prescribed statistical thresholds,
concluding that the articulated conceptual framework holds
significance.Research limitations&#x2F;implicationsThe study has significant
implications for managers, researchers and anyone involved in making,
implementing or evaluating decisions related to digital government
through GAI. However, the study has limitations, including a limited
sample size and contextualisation of the Indian public
sector.Originality&#x2F;valueThe study contributes to existing knowledge by
showing that implementing GAI positively correlates with improving
government functionality. It further highlights the significance of GAI
implementation according to the specific organisational context.</abstract>

      <abstract>Introduction
Increasingly, the label &#x60;&#x60;data trust&#39;&#39; is being applied to repeatable
mechanisms or approaches to sharing data in a timely, fair, safe, and
equitable way. However, there is an absence of practical guidance
regarding how to establish and operate a data trust.
Aim and approach
In December 2019, the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the
Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence convened a working meeting
of 19 people representing 15 Canadian organizations&#x2F;initiatives involved
in data sharing, most of which focus on public sector health data. The
objective was to identify essential requirements for the establishment
and operation of data trusts in the Canadian context. Preliminary
requirements were discussed during the meeting and then refined as
authors contributed to this manuscript.
Results
Twelve minimum specification requirements (&#39;&#39;min specs&#39;&#39;) for data
trusts were identified. The foundational min spec is that data trusts
must meet all legal requirements, including legal authority to collect,
hold or share data. In addition, there was agreement that data trusts
must have (i) an accountable governing body to ensure that the data
trust achieves its stated purpose and is transparent, (ii) comprehensive
data management including clear processes and qualified individuals
responsible for the collection, storage, access, disclosure and use of
data, (iii) training and accountability requirements for all data users
and (iv) ongoing public and stakeholder engagement.
Conclusions
Practical guidance for the establishment and operation of data trusts
was articulated in the form of 12 min specs requirements. The 12 min
specs are a starting point. Future work to refine and strengthen them
with members of the public, companies, and additional research data
stakeholders from within and outside of Canada, is recommended.</abstract>

      <abstract>Numerous governments worldwide have issued national artificial
intelligence (AI) strategies in the last five years to deal with the
opportunities and challenges posed by this technology. However, a
systematic understanding of the roles and functions that the governments
are taking is lacking in the academic literature. Therefore, this
research uses qualitative content analysis and Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) topic modeling methodologies to investigate the texts
of 31 strategies from across the globe. The findings of the qualitative
content analysis highlight thirteen functions of the state, which
include human capital, ethics, R&amp;D, regulation, data, private sector
support, public sector applications, diffusion and awareness, digital
infrastructure, national security, national challenges, international
cooperation, and financial support. We combine these functions into
three general themes, representing the state&#39;s role: development,
control, and promotion. LDA topic modeling results are also reflective
of these themes. Each general theme is present in every national
strategy&#39;s text, but the proportion they occupy in the text is
different. The combined typology based on two methods reveals that the
countries from the post-soviet bloc and East Asia prioritize the theme
&#x60;&#x60;development,&#39;&#39; highlighting the high level of the state&#39;s
involvement in AI innovation. The countries from the EU focus on
&#x60;&#x60;control,&#39;&#39; which reflects the union&#39;s hard stance on AI regulation,
whereas countries like the UK, the US, and Ireland emphasize a more
hands-off governance arrangement with the leading role of the private
sector by prioritizing &#x60;&#x60;promotion.&#39;&#39;</abstract>

      <abstract>The present study is an attempt to identify factors of failure of Heavy, Medium &amp; Light Engineering CPSE, how to predict failure and effective prediction methods. The study is apparent as the escalating number of failures, forcing the management and policy makers to design new strategies and regulation to avoid probable failure. The Principle Component Analysis shows the degree of the factors is responsiblefor the failure of CPSEs. Further, these variables were tested by using a Statistical and machine learning approach to develop the prediction model. The result of logistic regression has an accuracy of 83.9% in predicting the failure. The prediction accuracy of the Support vector machine is 93.5% whereas Random forest has 96.3% accuracy. The results show that the accuracy of machine learning approach is higher than statistical approach. The failure of the CPSEs may be avoided if indications are timely established and the correct prediction model must be applied. © Indian Institute of Finance.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: WHO has recommended HPV testing for cervical screening where it is practical and affordable. If used, it is important to both clarify and implement the clinical management of positive results. We estimated the performance in Lusaka, Zambia of a novel screening&#x2F;triage approach combining HPV typing with visual assessment assisted by a deep-learning approach called automated visual evaluation (AVE). Methods: In this well-established cervical cancer screening program nested inside public sector primary care health facilities, experienced nurses examined women with high-quality digital cameras; the magnified illuminated images permit inspection of the surface morphology of the cervix and expert telemedicine quality assurance. Emphasizing sensitive criteria to avoid missing precancer&#x2F;cancer, ~ 25% of women screen positive, reflecting partly the high HIV prevalence. Visual screen-positive women are treated in the same visit by trained nurses using either ablation (~ 60%) or LLETZ excision, or referred for LLETZ or more extensive surgery as needed. We added research elements (which did not influence clinical care) including collection of HPV specimens for testing and typing with BD Onclarity™ with a five channel output (HPV16, HPV18&#x2F;45, HPV31&#x2F;33&#x2F;52&#x2F;58, HPV35&#x2F;39&#x2F;51&#x2F;56&#x2F;59&#x2F;66&#x2F;68, human DNA control), and collection of triplicate cervical images with a Samsung Galaxy J8 smartphone camera™ that were analyzed using AVE, an AI-based algorithm pre-trained on a large NCI cervical image archive. The four HPV groups and three AVE classes were crossed to create a 12-level risk scale, ranking participants in order of predicted risk of precancer. We evaluated the risk scale and assessed how well it predicted the observed diagnosis of precancer&#x2F;cancer. Results: HPV type, AVE classification, and the 12-level risk scale all were strongly associated with degree of histologic outcome. The AVE classification showed good reproducibility between replicates, and added finer predictive accuracy to each HPV type group. Women living with HIV had higher prevalence of precancer&#x2F;cancer; the HPV-AVE risk categories strongly predicted diagnostic findings in these women as well. Conclusions: These results support the theoretical efficacy of HPV-AVE-based risk estimation for cervical screening. If HPV testing can be made affordable, cost-effective and point of care, this risk-based approach could be one management option for HPV-positive women. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in
law-making and law enforcement, analyzing it through the lens of the
technological paradigm theory and utilizing a new methodology rooted in
post-classical scientific rationality. The examination of the AI&#39;s legal
personality takes into account the modern anthropocentrism standpoint,
where humans are perceived as the central figure in the legal system. A
human, as a subject of law, plays a crucial role in constructing legal
reality. Through exercising his powers, a human transforms abstract
norms into existing law. The proposal to delegate this anthropological
function to AI carries significant risks that may have detrimental
effects on the established system of legal regulation for public
relations. The correlation between law-making and law enforcement, as
integral components in establishing legal reality, pertains to the legal
consciousness of individuals as subjects of law. This correlation does
not necessitate the substitution of human decision- making with AI.
Simultaneously, AI is capable of effectively handling auxiliary legal
tasks. It possesses the necessary skills to draft regulatory acts, court
decisions, and consolidate proposals obtained through law-making
crowdsourcing. Additionally, it is proficient in executing automated
actions, such as issuing writs of execution. The utilization of AI to
implement the concept of machine- readable law and algorithmize the
application of legal norms appears to hold promise. The incorporation of
a digital state notion, which pertains to the transition of public
service provision into digital format, is also unattainable without AI,
which greatly enhances the public administration efficiency. In this
case, the focal point will revolve around the matter of attaining
effective control over decisions carried out by AI, as well as the
prescribed boundaries of its capabilities within the legal domain, as
established by legislative measures.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big Data is the most trending topic in the computer science field. This big data analysis is booming field in present days and used to get the insight in the particular domain. Big data analytics is used to solve many problems and get the predations of many upcoming problems. Big Data refers to the huge dataset which is not managed and handle by old traditional methods. Big Data plays a very important role in effective management of e-governance. In this paper we collect the kishan call center (KCC) data as the data is in semi structured format i.e in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format so we used mongoDB to store. For analysis purpose before using the data we had converted it into the structured format. After converting into the structured format we created charts for better understanding. This paper focuses on how the big data and analysis is helpful for good e-governance. This big data is useful to get the insight and predictive analysis that gives good e-governance. © 2017 SERSC Australia.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article presents an exploratory qualitative single case study about
whether and how artificial intelligence (AI) is used by the Scottish
Government, about the key concerns relating to its usage, and about
obstacles to, and drivers of AI usage. Besides the academic literature
and published reports, the analysis rests on 12 semi-structured
interviews. Interviewees include Scottish Government employees, experts
from academia and representatives of commercial and non-commercial AI
and Big Data organisations. The article finds that the Scottish
Government has, so far, made little use of AI. Currently, AI is used in
very limited ways in process automation and for gaining &#x60;cognitive
insights&#39; with the human in control. There are no &#x60;strategic&#39; AI
applications where advanced reasoning and &#x60;decision-making by algorithm&#39;
play a role. Data-driven e-policy making is not currently on the cards.
The reasons are the Scottish Government&#39;s wariness of AI, a lack of
&#x60;digital maturity&#39; (concerning Big Data and digital infrastructure, but
also expertise) in the public sector, and ethical concerns around the
use of AI. Governments need to conduct a debate about the extent of AI
usage to avoid &#x60;AI creep&#39; in their institutions and to assure that AI
does not have negative consequences for democracy.</abstract>

      <abstract>This introductory and exploratory study delves into the use of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in the public sector in Portugal.
Our focus is on the role of public policies in promoting AI use in the
public sector and the importance of Public Law in regulating its impact.
We highlight specific provisions on regulating the public use of AI, the
principle of good administration, and the transparency and justification
of administrative activity carried out through AI systems. We also
consider the (judicial) control of administrative activity supported by
AI systems by the administrative jurisdiction, as well as the measure of
the legal admissibility of AI systems&#39; use by the public jurisdiction.
Lastly, we analyze the particularities of State liability for damages
caused by (public) AI systems, with a focus on the exercise of the
administrative function.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big Data and artificial intelligence will have a profound
transformational impact on governments around the world. Thus, it is
important for scholars to provide a useful analysis on the topic to
public managers and policymakers. This study offers an in-depth review
of the Policy and Administration literature on the role of Big Data and
advanced analytics in the public sector. It provides an overview of the
key themes in the research field, namely the application and benefits of
Big Data throughout the policy process, and challenges to its adoption
and the resulting implications for the public sector. It is argued that
research on the subject is still nascent and more should be done to
ensure that the theory adds real value to practitioners. A critical
assessment of the strengths and limitations of the existing literature
is developed, and a future research agenda to address these gaps and
enrich our understanding of the topic is proposed.</abstract>

      <abstract>PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to show how data mining techniques
can improve the performance management of the judiciary, helping judges
in steering position with specific and timely measures. It explores
different approaches to analyse the length of trials, based on the case
of an Italian judicial office.Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approachThe paper
presents a temporal analysis to compare the timeliness of trials, using
data and process mining approaches with the support of a specific
software to represent graphically the results. Data were gathered
directly from the office data base, improving precision and the
opportunity to monitor specific phases of the trials.FindingsThe results
highlight the progress that can be reached using data mining approaches
to develop performance analyses helping courts to correct inefficiencies
and to manage the personnel distribution, overcoming the critical
comments arisen against traditional KPI (Raine, 2000). The work proposes
a methodology to analyse cases deriving from different juridical matters
useful to set up a performance monitoring system that could be diffused
to different courts.Research limitations&#x2F;implicationsThe limitations of
the research regard the analysis of a selected, limited number of cases
in terms of judicial matters.Practical implicationsData mining
techniques can improve the performance management processes in providing
more accurate feedback to the judicial offices leaders and increasing
the organisational learning.Social implicationsThe performance of the
judiciary is one of the relevant issues that emerged in the recent
decade in the field of public sector reforms. Several reasons explain
this interest, which has gone beyond the specific legal disciplines to
involve public policy, management, economics and ICT
studies.Originality&#x2F;valueConsidering the literature on the judiciary
(Visser et al., 2019; Di Martino et al., 2021; Troisi and Alfano, 2023)
the contribution differs as both the methodological approach and the
predictive analysis considers the intrinsic differences that define
cases belonging to different juridical matters performing a
cross-sectional analysis, with a specific focus of process variants.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper draws attention to new complexities of deploying artificial intelligence (AI) to sensitive contexts, such as welfare allocation. AI is increasingly used in public administration with the promise of improving decision-making through predictive modelling. To accurately predict, it needs all the agreed criteria used as part of decisions, formal and informal. This paper empirically explores the informal classifications used by caseworkers to make unemployed welfare seekers &#39;fit&#39; into the formal categories applied in a Danish job centre. Our findings show that these classifications are documentable, and hence traceable to AI. However, to the caseworkers, they are at odds with the stable explanations assumed by any bureaucratic recording system as they involve negotiated and situated judgments of people&#39;s character. Thus, for moral reasons, caseworkers find them ill-suited for formal representation and predictive purposes and choose not to write them down. As a result, although classification work is crucial to the job centre&#39;s activities, AI is denuded of the real-world (and real work) character of decision-making in this context. This is an important finding for CSCW as it is not only about whether AI can &#39;do&#39; decision-making in particular contexts, as previous research has argued. This paper shows that problems may also be caused by people&#39;s unwillingness to provide data to systems. It is the purpose of this paper to present the empirical results of this research, followed by a discussion of implications for AI-supported practice and research. © 2021 ACM.</abstract>

      <abstract>The unprecedented increase in computing power and data availability has significantly altered the way and the scope that organizations make decisions relying on technologies. There is a conspicuous trend that organizations are seeking the use of frontier technologies with the purpose of helping the delivery of services and making day-to-day operational decisions. Machine learning (ML) is the fastest growing and at the same time, the most debated and controversial of these technologies. Although there is a great deal of research in the literature related to machine learning applications, most of them focus on the technical aspects or private sector use. The governmental machine learning applications suffer the lack of theoretical and empirical studies and unclear governance framework. This paper reviews the literature on the use of machine learning by government, aiming to identify the benefits and challenges of wider adoption of machine learning applications in the public sector and to propose the directions for future research. © 2021, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

      <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue that philosophic and administrative thought have enframed (Heidegger, 1977) us to unconsciously accept technology in public administration and the bureaucracy. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: It builds on literature in phenomenology. Findings: It discusses the implications of this phenomenon for organizational decision-making, management, and governance more broadly. Practical implications: It questions whether we should utilize video technology in policing, and examine technology as good or bad before implementing it. Originality&#x2F;value: Most of the critiques of technology were in the early 1990s. This paper attempts to explain why we implicitly accept technology, links the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to Herbert Simon, and articulates how technology shapes our thinking. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>The increasing role of emerging technologies, such as big data, the
Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive
technologies, cloud computing, and mobile technologies, is essential to
the business process manager profession&#39;s sustainable development.
Nevertheless, these technologies could involve new challenges in labor
markets. The era of intelligent business process management (BPM) has
begun, but how does it look in real labor markets? This paper examines
the hypothesis that the transformation of the business process manager
profession has been caused by certain determinants that involve the need
for an improvement in BPM skills. The main contribution is a model of
the dimensions of the impact of digital technologies on business process
management supplemented with skills that influence the business process
manager profession. The paper fills the gap in research on perspectives
of the impact of digital technologies on business process management,
considering both a literature analysis and labor market research. The
purpose of the literature review was to identify the core dimensions
that drive the use of emerging technologies in business process
management. The labor market study was conducted in order to analyze the
current demand for core skills of business process managers in the
Polish labor market with a particular emphasis on the intelligent BPM
concept. Additionally, to study the determinants that slow down the iBPM
concept&#39;s development, the digital intensity level of the enterprises
and public administration units in Poland was studied. Finally, a fuzzy
cognitive map presenting the core determinants of the business process
manager profession&#39;s transformation is described.</abstract>

      <abstract>The development of intelligent routines to support complex
decision-making is not always straight-forward. In the public service
the difficulties may be related to the abundance of available data
sources and the number of legal standards to be met, in addition to the
need for the incorporation of transparency, auditability,
standardization, and desirable reuse in the IT systems. This article
presents the Domain Engineering process carried out to obtain a feature
model for the implementation of a Framework that uses Artificial
Intelligence for dealing with the governmental rules to support public
decision-making. One highlight of the put forward framework is that it
supports both, end users and IT people (i.e., experts in business and in
technology), that are not experienced with intelligent techniques as
well as it focuses on Compliance. For this research, the Design Science
Research Methodology method was used, sorting the work into the steps of
the problem identification and motivation, the definition of goals, the
design and development, the verification and validation of the
experiments, and the communication of the results. A systematic review
identifying the lack of an AI Framework in the Public Sector was carried
out beforehand. The research produced a Whitebox Framework aiming to
supply recommendations for both groups of users based on solutions that
have already been tested and applied to know problems in their
respective areas, e.g., anomaly detection, fraud identification, rule
extraction, and risk management, among others focused on Compliance.
Moreover, the framework was built so that it can be evolved by experts
with due use.</abstract>

      <abstract>Emerging technologies, e.g., cloud computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, and information technologies, facilitate digital transformation and promote digital services. Significant research exists on the acceptance and use of technologies and specific digital transformation (DT) practices. However, more research is needed to better understand user’s acceptance and how they use technology to better de-sign digital services. Thus, this paper: 1) proposes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the models of acceptance and use of technologies, as well as of certain DT practices applied to the human-computer interaction (HCI) of digital services; 2) provides an analysis of the results of the behavior of the factors and practices; and 3) proposes a taxonomy of the acceptance and use factors applied to HCI of digital services by economic activity. The main contribution of this work is the proposed taxonomy in a vacancy area relevant to digital transformation efforts applied to digital services pursued globally, both in the private and public sectors. © 2023, Facultad de Informatica, Universidad Nacional de La Plata.

      <abstract>Research and development of applications for smart cities are extremely relevant considering the various problems that population growth will bring to large urban centers in the next few years. Although research on cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, embedded devices, sensor and actuator networks, and participatory sensing, among other paradigms, is driving the growth of solutions, there are a lot of challenges that need to be addressed. Based on these observations, in this work, we present an integrated system architecture for decision-making support and urban planning by introducing its building blocks (termed components): sensing&#x2F;actuation, local processing, communication, cloud platform, and application components. In the sensing&#x2F;actuation component, we present the major relevant resources for data collection, identification devices, and actuators that can be used in smart city solutions. Sensing&#x2F;actuation component is followed by the local processing component, which is responsible for processing, decision-making support, and control in local scale. The communication component, as the connection element among all these components, is presented with an emphasis on the open-access metropolitan area network and cellular networks. The cloud platform is the essential component for urban planning and integration with electronic governance legacy systems, and finally, the application component, in which the government administrator and users have access to public management tools, citizen services, and other urban planning resources. © The Author(s) 2019.</abstract>

      <abstract>The public sector presents important steps for digital transformation.
Digital transformation uses a series of tools and methods to improve the
relationship with citizens and improve benefits. This paper explores the
role of artificial intelligence (AI) in governance processes and
provides public institutions with insight regarding the impact of
integrating chatbot communication tools when interacting with citizens.
The present research provides an analysis of the socio-economic factors
that determine the use of artificial intelligence tools, i.e., the
propensity to interact more with the public administration as a result
of improved communication through virtual assistants, and highlights the
implications of AI in improving services towards civil society by
determining the degree of satisfaction on aspects such as reduced
waiting times in queues, access to information regardless of the
traditional working hours of civil servants, quicker execution of
operations, et al. The results, derived from an analysis of 507 sets of
responses obtained from an online questionnaire, indicate that a number
of variables, such as residential environment, employment status,
household income and education level, significantly impact the
effectiveness of artificial intelligence in mediating citizen
communication with government.</abstract>

      <abstract>In the recent years, existing public buildings have been put under the spotlight for the application of retrofit strategies prescribed by the European Energy Efficiency Directives. Among them, schools have a pivotal role since, besides energy performance, they have to cope also with high indoor environmental quality requirements. However, the definition of a refurbishment policy for the stock of school buildings presents some criticalities: limited data are often available, comprehensive energy audits are too onerous to apply to each school building, and the findings of many case-studies discussed in the literature can be too specific for a robust generalization. In this context, this work proposes a new integrated method for energy audit on large stocks of existing buildings, avoiding case-by-case analyses and focusing on identifying the most significant retrofit areas and priorities of intervention. This approach, based on the combination of different data mining techniques (i.e., Wrapper Feature Selection, Random Forests, Hierarchical and k-medoids Clustering), is meant to deliver a useful tool for the existing buildings’ stock to professionals and Public Administrations. The method is described and discussed, and then applied for validation purpose on a case study of 41 educational buildings in the Province of Treviso, Italy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>African public administrations are in an especially difficult position
with respect to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), in both
how they harness its benefits but also in managing potential harms.
Through a narrative review of existing research, this paper synthesises
findings from previous digital government implementations on the African
continent, and considers the implications for AI use. The analysis is
centred on the way public officials are bypassed or empowered to work
with emerging technologies, and the influence of public service values
on their adoption. Four concerns emerge as relevant: Integrity of
recommendations provided by decision-support systems, including how they
are influenced by local organisational practices and the reliability of
underlying infrastructures; Inclusive decision-making that balances the
(assumed) objectivity of data-driven algorithms and the influence of
different stakeholder groups; Exception and accountability in how
digital and AI platforms are funded, developed, implemented and used;
and an expectation of Complete understanding of people and events
through the integration of traditionally dispersed data sources and
systems, and how policy actors seek to mitigate the risks associated
with this aspiration.</abstract>

      <abstract>The purpose of this article was to present the methodology which enables automatic map labelling. This topic is particularly important in the context of the ongoing research into the full automation of visualization process of spatial data stored in the currently used topographic databases (e.g. OpenStreetMap, Vector Map Level 2, etc.). To carry out this task, the artificial neural network (multilayer perceptron) was used. The Vector Map Level 2 was used as a test database. The data for neural network learning (the reference label localization) was obtained from the military topographic map at scale 1 : 50 000. In the article, the method of applying artificial neural networks to the map labelling is presented. Detailed research was carried out on the basis of labels from the feature class &quot;built-up area&quot;. The results of the analyses revealed that it is possible to use the artificial intelligence computational methods to automate the process of placing labels on maps. The results showed that 65% of the labels were put on the topographic map in the same place as in the case of the labelling which was done manually by a cartographer. The obtained results can contribute both to the enhancement of the quality of cartographic visualization (e.g. in geoportals) and the partial elimination of the human factor in this process. Highlights for public administration, management and planning: •Map label placement is among key variables ensuring the usability of topographic maps across disciplines. •We present the neural network approach for automating the process of labelling topographic maps with locality names. •The presented case study applies to the military map in scale 1:50 000, but can be applied on other maps and geoportals. © 2019 Krzysztof Pokonieczny et al., published by Sciendo.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article raises the problem of society’s and individuals’ trust in the law during the digital transformation. It identifies factors that in many ways lead to decreased trust in the law. These factors include geopolitical crises and the changes the world experienced during the pandemic, as well as processes of poorer quality rulemaking, public administration, legal drafting and enforcement. It also identifies reasons why the law lags behind the realities of widespread use of new digital technologies in the XXI century, in which the number of gaps in the legal regulation system becomes critical for jurisprudence, legal theory, society and the state. It has been found that increasing information pressure on the individual and the individual’s openness and defenselessness to information flows, as well as stress and the infodemic, particularly during a pandemic and geopolitical crisis, destroy the ability to shape critical thinking. Due to overload, they deprive people of skills for effectively learning something new and developing creatively. Also, the more time the individual spends in the information space, subjected to powerful targeting technologies, the less right he or she has to choose. This is particularly the case now as the world is dominated by a couple dozen global digital platforms that provide people and small and medium business with an ever-expanding range of services, which means they no longer have the economic ability to choose other, alternative solutions. The changes that have occurred in the system of people being forced to work remotely, “regulatory administration”, the use of people’s fear and confusion, have questioned the authority of the law. The article concludes that identifying information law’s place in Russia and the modern world, including issues of the need to systematize information legislation for the country and society at a time when digital data are becoming the basis for a growing number of social interactions, seems to be one of the important processes to boost trust in the law as a social regulator. The article raises issues of the legal regulation of the circulation of big data, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence and other digital technologies. It analyzes a number of legal issues, including the generation of consistent hierarchical legal terminology for the Internet of things and a common vision of the system of IoT legal issues requiring new or modified solutions in light of industry specifics and the current state of the regulatory framework. At the current stage of humanity’s development, the “right to reject the use of digital technologies” could be a rational tool to strike a balance between individuals’ rights and the public interest. Therefore, it will be important for achieving the goals of information law to create a system that protects the rights of those who are unable, unwilling or afraid to use new sophisticated technological solutions such as various cutting-edge digital technologies, including artificial intelligence technologies. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

      <abstract>In the new contemporary pandemic paradigm, higher education in public
administration and beyond knows challenges, barriers, and opportunities
for the academic process. Shocks, environmental changes and physical
distancing in recent years have led to the implementation of efficient
solutions in educational services, based on artificial intelligence
(AI). Thus, in the global academic landscape, many international
universities have adopted a &#x60;chatbot&#39;, a digital interface designed to
stimulate conversation with people. Modern algorithmic communications
have effects, such as: increasing the number of enrollments in public
administration programs, improving academic experience and active
student participation, while reducing administrative tasks on university
staff. This paper aims to provide a glimpse on the perceptions of the
potential impact of conversational artificial intelligence on public
administration (PA) programs from universities and to reflect on its
implications for university leaders and staff work and also on students&#39;
engagement. The paper will focus on how AI tools will help university
programs to be more effective, and how technology will support the
limited human resources in this sector. In order to gather the data for
this research, the interview was used as well as case studies from
international universities that have implemented a chatbot. The research
findings capture technological and digital advances that will continue
to shape the higher education landscape and its curricula, especially in
PA programs. As a result, leaders will need to monitor how artificial
intelligence, in particular conversational agents, influences
universities&#39; images; attraction and retention for students in PA
programs and other important partners; staff productivity, and how to be
more proactive in initiating pilot projects. This is one of the few
publications that looks at the expectations for conversational AI in
higher education today. In this sense, implementing a chatbot can be a
competitive advantage in a market where modern technologies weigh
heavily and make a difference.</abstract>

      <abstract>Democratic governance has become a popular term to influence public sector reform in many countries. As a new governance theory, democratic governance has also gained significant interest from scholarly circles. Scholars had different perspectives when discussing the topic of democratic governance. Political perspectives examined democratic governance, especially in terms of states, regime, election and democracy. Technological perspective saw the importance of ICTs, social media, artificial intelligence and big data. The public administration perspective studied the importance of public policy, public management and local government institutions. There were rarely scholars who mapped the ideas about democratic governance. The study tries to fill this gap in thinking about democratic governance by reviewing the journal articles on democratic governance published in Scopus data based. Via NVivo analysis tools, this study showed five pivotal issues, including “government,” “public,” “policy,” “political,’ and ‘institutional.’ Besides, this study revealed some important sub-issues of the pivotal issues, covered ‘responsible government,” “representative government,” “government policy,” “public participation,” “public affairs,” “public interest,” “public policy,” “policy formulation,” “policy implementation,” “political participation,” “political actors,” “political authority,” “institutional change,” “institutional capacity,” “state institutions.’ This study also developed propositions from the pivotal issues and sub-issues. Furthermore, this study proposed a new theoretical model based on the propositions. Finally, this study acknowledges the weaknesses and suggests future research. © 2021 Women&#39;s Health Care.

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way organizations
face decision-making issues. One of these crucial elements is the
implementation of organizational changes. There has been a wide-spread
adoption of AI techniques in the private sector, whereas in the public
sector their use has been recently extended. One of the greatest
challenges that European governments have to face is the implementation
of a wide variety of European Union (EU) funding programs which have
evolved in the context of the EU long-term budget. In the current study,
the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are
intertwined with forecasting the outcomes of a co-financed EU program by
means of its impact on the non-financial measures of the government body
that materialized it. The predictive accuracy of the present model
advanced in this research study takes into account all the complexities
of the business environment, within which the provided dataset is
produced. The outcomes of the study showed that the measures taken to
enhance customer satisfaction allows for further improvement. The
utilization of the proposed model could facilitate the decision-making
process and initiate changes to the administrational issues of the
available funding programs.</abstract>

      <abstract>The use of artificial intelligence to support decision-making is a
reality in the current scenario. Discussions on data processing -
whether through supervised learning or through unsupervised learning
(deep learning) - gain relevance in the field of law. At the same time
that they gain relevance, however, challenges arise regarding the
results that emerge due to data processing (output), insofar as these
may be biased due to the data set coming from the physical world, of
conceptions and human relations. Due to these challenges, this article
aims to point out such aspects in the contemporary context and propose
measures that can be adopted as possible solutions. The analysis about
the existence of an antidote as a counterpoint to the bias is necessary,
in order to qualify the continuous and unstoppable use of these
technologies. Dealing with the difficulties of the subject in the
constitutional scope and in the light of Brazilian legislation, in turn,
justifies the importance of the subject and allowed a proposal for such
challenges that arise due to the use of artificial intelligence.
Therefore, this article makes use of bibliographical research on the
subject and of systemic interpretation between the Federal Constitution
and legislation that address legal aspects of Public Administration.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article considers the peculiarities of the formation and
implementation of tax policy in the development of the digital economy,
reveals current problems, and substantiates the need to change the tax
system. The directions of compensation of the reduction of income from
the labor tax through automation and introduction of artificial
intelligence in technological processes are defined and the forms of
taxation of digital commerce are offered. The research methods were
scientific abstraction, logic, graphics, visual reflection, analytics.
It has been proven that the process of digitalization of the economy in
combination with the crisis caused by COVID-19 causes many risks that
must be considered when developing tax policy. Emphasis is placed on the
implementation of a tax policy based on digital transformation, which
stimulates innovation, ensures efficiency, and improves the quality of
tax services. Increasing the use of digital technologies has been shown
to create challenges in many areas of public administration, including
taxation. It concludes that there is a need for broad international
cooperation to prevent tax evasion, ensure tax transparency and develop
new tax approaches and software.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article discusses the human rights implications of algorithmic decision-making in the social welfare sphere. It does so against the background of the 2020 Hague’s District Court judgment in a case challenging the Dutch government’s use of System Risk Indication—an algorithm designed to identify potential social welfare fraud. Digital welfare state initiatives are likely to fall short of meeting basic requirements of legality and protecting against arbitrariness. Moreover, the intentional opacity surrounding the implementation of algorithms in the public sector not only hampers the effective exercise of human rights but also undermines proper judicial oversight. The analysis unpacks the relevance and complementarity of three legal&#x2F;regulatory frameworks governing algorithmic systems: data protection, human rights law and algorithmic accountability. Notwithstanding these frameworks’ invaluable contribution, the discussion casts doubt on whether they are well-suited to address the legal challenges pertaining to the discriminatory effects of the use of algorithmic systems. © The Author(s) [2022].

      <abstract>This study was designed to determine the perceived online learning
readiness (OLR) of LIS (Library and Information Sciences) &#x2F; IM
(Information Management) students in Pakistan during COVID-19 pandemic.
A quantitative approach based on survey method was used to collect data
from 340 LIS students from nine public sector universities of Pakistan
through an online questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using
the SPSS and AMOS. The findings revealed that LIS students were not
fully personalized and successful in decisions about their online
educational activities during COVID-19 pandemic. However, they were
motivated to learn through online learning and felt confident in
performing basic functions of computers and internet. A significant
difference of opinion was observed on ?computer&#x2F;internet self-efficacy?
and ?online communication self-efficacy? based on respondents? gender.
Similarly, students from different levels of degree programs reported
significantly different computer, internet, and online communication
self-efficacy and learning motivation. Moreover, the age and grades of
respondents were noted to be strong predictors of their OLR. These
findings would be helpful for library schools, universities, and faculty
members in Pakistan to improve the quality of online education and
implement clear policies and guidelines. This study provides some
theoretical and practical implications based on the findings.</abstract>

      <abstract>Trust in government, policy effectiveness and the governance agenda has rarely been more important than in the opening decades of the twenty first century. For that reason, we herein present centgovspend, an open source software library which provides functionality to automatically scrape and parse central government spending at the micro level. While the design ideals are internationally applicable to any future data origination pipelines, we specifically tailor it to the United Kingdom, a country which is unique not only in terms of its transparency in procurement, but also one which was subject to a parliamentary expenses scandal, years of austerity, and then a volatile political process regarding a referendum to leave the European Union. The library optionally reconciles suppliers and subsequently analyzes payments made to private entities. Our implementation results in scraping over 4.9m payments worth over £3.5tn in value. As a way of showcasing what such a dataset makes possible, we outline three prototype applications in the fields of public administration (procurement across Standard Industry Classifier), sociology (stratification across those who supply government) and network science (board interlock across suppliers) before presenting suggestions for the future direction of public procurement data origination and analysis. 2019 © The Authors.

      <abstract>Indonesia depends on national and governmental regulations to ensure legal certainty and provide guidelines on how existing subjects of law must act in accordance with the laws. As the House of Representatives of The Republic of Indonesia (DPR RI) recently adopted systems to provide transparency on the law legislation process, they probably encountered the constantly changing nature caused by economic factors, social factors, and technological context. However, the sophistication and interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly increased. Thus, AI has the potential to bring game-changing contextual changes in Administrative Agencies. The authors of this paper examined how the government should incorporate and regulate AI, and how it can guide Indonesia in modernizing the public sector and introduce safeguards to govern the use and adoption of AI. The authors intended to analyze the challenges and potential benefits of using AI in Administrative Agencies by examining the usage and development of AI in the U.S. Federal agencies. Currently, incorporating AI can address Indonesia’s disruptive regulatory gaps and overlapping authorities; however, these obstacles also impede the successful incorporation of AI. Hence, the AI scheme in regulatory oversight will be able to reduce such problems only if the Indonesian government begins to adopt AI. © 2022 Kasetsart University.</abstract>

Minnesota satisfaction questionnaire (MSQ) or job description ındex (JDI) (Castanheira, 2014; Saane et al., 2003) are widely used to measure job satisfaction. However, since these instruments cannot be generalised to all industrial sectors (Khalilzadeh et al., 2013), this two-part study attempted to manifest the facets of job satisfaction of public sector bank employees in India through factor identification using systematic literature review, exploratory factor analysis and statistical mode, followed by partial least squares (PLS) modelling of the problem using SmartPLS and comparing the outcome to artificial neural networks (ANN) output. The study has important implications for policy recommendations to banking sector to promote satisfaction among employees. Secondly, it is able to demonstrate which of the two techniques is better – PLS or ANN. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>Globalisation and advancements in technology have caused a radical shift in political and economic landscapes, forcing companies and business alliances to rethink strategies. In a highly competitive scenario, firms are increasingly investing in technology, software, data and artificial intelligence to enhance capabilities and gain competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to analyse how knowledge-based organisations perceive effectiveness through innovation and performance management practices. A total of 200 employees in the Indian public sector were surveyed. Hierarchical regression analysis and correlation analysis techniques were used to analyse data. Results show that performance management practices are antecedents of organisational effectiveness. Innovation offers organisations greater competence and advantage over rival companies in the public sector. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>The paper aims at analysing the most relevant examples of the use of artificial intelligence within the Italian public administrations, in order to highlight related benefits and risks. It focuses on the internal organization, rulemaking and enforcement decisions. There appears to be a need for a general regulatory framework, as well as for specific procedural disciplines in each administration in order to allow real accessibility, comprehensibility and non-discrimination for the stakeholders. At the same time, these disciplines should introduce mechanisms and evaluation adequate to verify the appropriateness of the use of artificial intelligence instead of human intelligence, with a view to the effectiveness of organization and administrative action. © 2022.

      <abstract>The community’s rise, public opinion network’s popularity, and emergency personnel’s advancement have changed drastically. Individuals can now go online from any place and through communications systems to share their opinions and attitudes more efficiently and more often. As illustrated by the preceeding network approach, public sentiment on neural networks and IoT is critical for the public sector, the public interest, and a special event in an emergency (IoT). In terms of data security and anonymity, the proposed program is not safe and has environmental problems. Network public opinion’s approach is based on FPGAs and machine education. FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array) Instant perspectives, possible future themes, knowledge exchange, excellent content and Team variance are used to build machine learning. In this popular sentiment network, several disasters have seriously threatened the security of our community. Public views on disaster networks in all type of internet media, such as internet news, blogs and webpages, are inextricably connected with society. This plays into unprecedented stress the ability of the government to deal with crises and their consequences. © 2021, Semnan University, Center of Excellence in Nonlinear Analysis and Applications.

      <abstract>The clinician-performed point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a useful tool, and its scope includes bedside assessment of pulmonary (e.g., pneumothorax, pleural effusion), cardiac (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, ductus arteriosus), gastrointestinal (e.g., necrotising enterocolitis), and intracranial (e.g., intraventricular hemorrhage, cerebral blood flow velocities) pathologies, procedural guidance and rapid assessment of etiologies of acute clinical deterioration (e.g., pneumothorax, poor cardiac contractility, intraventricular hemorrhage). Despite its potential to improve patient care, a curriculum and a structured program for POCUS training is lacking in India. Homogenous approach to training and ongoing quality assurance is essential to optimize benefits of POCUS as an effective tool in clinical practice. The training needs, the legal and infrastructural barriers to successful implementation of POCUS, and strategies to implement the program at the national level are discussed. © 2023, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Investments in enabling technologies-including the fifth-generation
technology standard for broadband cellular networks (5G), artificial
intelligence (AI), and light detection and ranging (LIDAR)
technology-are important strategic decisions for firms. This paper asks
how inventions that private firms developed with (versus without)
public-sector partners differ in their enabling technology trajectory.
Using a novel method of machine learning matching, we compare patented
technologies generated from more than 30,000 public-private
relationships with comparable technologies invented by private firms
alone during a 21-year period. To measure the enabling potential of a
technology, we introduce a new enabling technology index. The findings
show that private-firm relationships with the public sector-in
particular cooperative agreements and grants with mission agencies
(National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of
Defense)-are likely starting points for enabling technology
trajectories. We thus put a spotlight on organizational arrangements
that combine the breadth of exploration (agreements, grants) with deep
exploitation in a particular domain (mission agency). A key contribution
is a better understanding of the types of private-firm efforts that are
associated with enabling technologies. We also challenge the common
assumption that enabling technologies have their origins only in
public-sector projects and show how private firms are involved. Our
significant contribution is to show how private firms can change
evolution of ecosystems through technology development.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public sector adoption of AI techniques in welfare systems recasts
historic national data as resource for machine learning. In this paper,
we examine how the use of register data for development of predictive
models produces new &#x60;afterlives&#39; for citizen data. First, we document a
Danish research project&#39;s practical efforts to develop an algorithmic
decision-support model for social workers to classify children&#39;s risk of
maltreatment. Second, we outline the tensions emerging from project
members&#39; negotiations about which datasets to include. Third, we
identify three types of afterlives for citizen data in machine learning
projects: (1) data afterlives for training and testing the algorithm,
acting as &#x60;ground truth&#39; for inferring futures, (2) data afterlives for
validating the algorithmic model, acting as markers of robustness, and
(3) data afterlives for improving the model&#39;s fairness, valuated for
reasons of data ethics. We conclude by discussing how, on one hand,
these afterlives engender new ethical relations between state and
citizens; and how they, on the other hand, also articulate an
alternative view on the value of datasets, posing interesting contrasts
between machine learning projects developed within the context of the
Danish welfare state and mainstream corporate AI discourses of the
bigger, the better.</abstract>

      <abstract>We examine ways to facilitate the digital financial inclusion of internal migrant workers in India, using technologies assisted by Artificial Intelligence. Internal migrant workers, whose vulnerabilities were cruelly exposed during COVID-19, constitute 37% of the population of India. We argue that an AI-enabled solution augmenting preexisting financial transaction processes in public sector banks and post offices could integrate vulnerable groups into the economy and empower them socio-politically. AI-assisted ATMs have the potential to improve digital financial inclusion, bring accountability, ensure security, build trust, and protect privacy in the process of empowering marginalized communities. The paper uses a case study method since it deals with a contemporary event, the deleterious impact of digital and financial exclusion of migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first wave of COVID-19, migrant laborers were stranded without access to basic needs. Facilitating digital financial inclusion could have provided access provisions in desperate situations. © 2023 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>

      <abstract>In many developed countries, the usage of artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) has become important in paving the future path
in how data is managed and secured in the small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) sector. SMEs in these developed countries have created their own
cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how
these countries&#39; SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and
attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based
on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity
(MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good
example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has
been successfully applied in many applications, including network
intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in
the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed
countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and
similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed.
Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also
explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative
methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how
operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security
guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling
on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations
to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This
paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to
identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber
security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low
adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger
companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured
quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across
an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs&#39; management and
technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based
on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary
data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place
but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection
was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and
challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low.
The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and
processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber
threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay
ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that
those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of
communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures.
This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise
cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial
assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly,
SMEs&#39; lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could
lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity
rules. Trying to find the right balance between this risk and impact,
versus productivity impact and costs, could lead to UK SMES getting over
these hurdles in this cyberspace in the quest for promoting the usage of
MLCS.
UK and Wales governments can use the research conducted in this paper to
inform and adapt their policies to help UK SMEs become more secure from
cyber-attacks and compare them to other developed countries also on the
same future path.</abstract>

      <abstract>A lot of different methods are being opted for improving the educational standards through monitoring of the classrooms. The developed world uses Smart classrooms to enhance faculty efficiency based on accumulated learning outcomes and interests. Smart classroom boards, audio-visual aids, and multimedia are directly related to the Smart classroom environment. Along with these facilities, more effort is required to monitor and analyze students’ outcomes, teachers’ performance, attendance records, and contents delivery in on-campus classrooms. One can achieve more improvement in quality teaching and learning outcomes by developing digital twins in on-campus classrooms. In this article, we have proposed DeepClass-Rooms, a digital twin framework for attendance and course contents monitoring for the public sector schools of Punjab, Pakistan. DeepClassRooms is cost-effective and requires RFID readers and high-edge computing devices at the Fog layer for attendance monitoring and content matching, using convolution neural network for on-campus and online classes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>These notes describe the evolution of the EU strategy for the integration of Third Country Nationals since the Tampere Program in 1999 until the second Action Program (2021–2027). It highlights the EU’s endeavor to close the gap between migrants and EU citizens in compliance with the EU general anti-discrimination policy and, since the entry of the Lisbon Treaty into force, of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Accordingly, the current integration strategy has a much wider legal and financial basis than the one described by art. 79.2 of the TFEU. This new individual-centered and wide-ranging public approach can now be strengthened through the new European Digital Agenda, whose aim is also to reframe and make the relations between the individual and public administration more user friendly. However, in the human mobility domain, the large EU acquis, which is currently focused on internal security, should be re-balanced from a legislative and operational point of view to avoid the risk of infringing on data protection principles and establishing a mass surveillance framework, which could be incompatible with the EU as a democratic society and a rule of law-abiding organization. Within this very complex framework, a promising development is the establishment of a new European Asylum Agency, which may pave the way for more consistent EU asylum and migration policies. © 2022 by the authors.

      <abstract>COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),
first emerged in Wuhan, China late in December 2019. Not long after, the
virus spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization in March 2020. This caused many changes around the world
and in the United States, including an educational shift towards online
learning. In this paper, we seek to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic
and the increase in online learning impact college students&#39; emotional
wellbeing. We use several machine learning and statistical models to
analyze data collected by the Faculty of Public Administration at the
University of Ljubljana, Slovenia in conjunction with an international
consortium of universities, other higher education institutions, and
students&#39; associations. Our results indicate that features related to
students&#39; academic life have the largest impact on their emotional
wellbeing. Other important factors include students&#39; satisfaction with
their university&#39;s and government&#39;s handling of the pandemic as well as
students&#39; financial security.</abstract>

      <abstract>Through the application of discrete choice and machine learning models, the primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of NGA networks coverage on reducing the risk of contagion during the first wave of COVID-19 across 278 municipalities in mainland Portugal, while controlling for other domains under the tutelage of the local public administration. Benchmark estimations reveal that, while holding everything else constant, each spatial unit is 2.4 p.p. more likely to become a high-risk municipality with additional 10 ​000 cabled houses with NGA networks. In a multinomial discrete choice model setting, the technical novelty of this study lies in providing graphical visualization and economic interpretation of coefficients and average marginal effects as a function of the number of classes used to define the dependent variable, while ensuring the satisfaction of the IIA assumption. The positive and significant coefficients of NGA indicate that additional coverage of NGA networks increases the likelihood of municipalities becoming high-risk for increasing number of spatial units not belonging to the low-risk efficiency frontier. The significant, negative, and decreasing average marginal effects of NGA suggest that the ability to remain a low-risk municipality diminishes with increasing NGA networks coverage as the number of municipalities belonging to the low-risk efficiency frontier decreases. The analysis also confirms that the effect of NGA networks coverage on COVID-19 is statistically significant in the indirect channel. This impact persists due to the mediation of population density, which is directly influenced by NGA networks coverage. All these findings can be explained by the fact that benefits related to productive activities do not outweigh costs associated with leisure time. Hence, this research emphasizes the need for a normative discussion on the intended purpose of digital technologies built on top of NGA networks to ensure a level playing field in the post-pandemic era. © 2023 The Author</abstract>

      <abstract>The adoption and recent development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are because of their widespread applications in the private and public sectors, from logistics to environment monitoring. The incorporation of 5G technologies, satellites, and UAVs has provoked telecommunication networks to advance to provide more stable and high-quality services to remote areas. However, UAVs are vulnerable to cyberattacks because of the rapidly expanding volume and poor inbuilt security. Cyber security and the detection of cyber threats might considerably benefit from the development of artificial intelligence. A machine learning algorithm can be trained to search for attacks that may be similar to other types of attacks. This study proposes a new approach: metaheuristics with machine learning-enabled cybersecurity in unmanned aerial vehicles (MMLCS-UAVs). The presented MMLCS-UAV technique mainly focuses on the recognition and classification of intrusions in the UAV network. To obtain this, the presented MMLCS-UAV technique designed a quantum invasive weed optimization-based feature selection (QIWO-FS) method to select the optimal feature subsets. For intrusion detection, the MMLCS-UAV technique applied a weighted regularized extreme learning machine (WRELM) algorithm with swallow swarm optimization (SSO) as a parameter tuning model. The experimental validation of the MMLCS-UAV method was tested using benchmark datasets. This widespread comparison study reports the superiority of the MMLCS-UAV technique over other existing approaches. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) contributes to public administration by
augmenting public services, including managing big data and information
technology. AI is currently utilized in e-government services that
contribute value to American citizens, including providing a
personalized customer experience, such as linking individualized data
and processing individual assistance requests. Furthermore, AI can take
over redundant routine tasks such as digital information provisioning
and delivering services. However, in the United States, there is no
overarching policy that governs AI. Inconsistent public policy
contributes to public distrust of AI, concerns about privacy intrusion,
and fears of inequitable service delivery. This review article discusses
the rapid emergence of government applications of AI and provides a
systematic review of proposed AI governance models. It then outlines
their common components for the purpose of building a coherent, yet
adaptable, AI Governance Framework and proposes a research agenda for
policy and administration researchers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Advancement in information technology continues to evolve especially in
the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Research studies have been
conducted to evaluate the perceptions of Americans on the development
and utilization of AI technology and if it is appropriate to use AI in
public administrative duties. The research revealed that society is
fragmented regarding the acceptance of AI, and whether AI decisions
could have long-term effects on the labor industry, legal system, and
national security. The 2018 AI Public Opinion Survey revealed
significant concerns among the American public regarding AI, yet also a
recognition of its promise. The goal of this article is to further
develop a governance framework for AI that considers the importance of
public trust in AI policy. First, it discusses the necessity of public
trust for the effective governance of emergent technology. Then, it
evaluates public opinion on AI technology that specifically pertains to
governance. The article concludes with a discussion of why public trust
is central to good AI governance.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: Because of the expansion of the internet and Web 2.0 phenomenon, new challenges are emerging in the disclosure practises adopted by organisations in the public-sector. This study aims to examine local governments’ (LGOs) use of social media (SM) in disclosing environmental actions&#x2F;plans&#x2F;information as a new way to improve accountability to citizens to obtain organisational legitimacy and the related sentiment of citizens’ judgements. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: This paper analyses the content of 39 Italian LGOs’ public pages on Facebook. After the distinction between five classes of environmental issues (air, water, energy, waste and territory), an initial study is performed to detect possible sub-topics applying latent Dirichlet allocation. Having a list of posts related to specific environmental themes, the researchers computed the sentiment of citizens’ comments. To measure sentiment, two different approaches were implemented: one based on a lexicon dictionary and the other based on convolutional neural networks. Findings: Facebook is used by LGOs to disclose environmental issues, focussing on their main interest in obtaining organisational legitimacy, and the analysis shows an increasing impact of Web 2.0 in the direct interaction of LGOs with citizens. On the other hand, there is a clear divergence of interest on environmental topics between LGOs and citizens in a dialogic accountability framework. Practical implications: Sentiment analysis (SA) could be used by politicians, but also by managers&#x2F;entrepreneurs in the business sector, to analyse stakeholders’ judgements of their communications&#x2F;actions and plans on corporate social responsibility. This tool gives a result on time (i.e. not months or years after, as for the reporting system). It is cheaper than a survey and allows a first “photograph” of stakeholders’ sentiment. It can also be a useful tool for supporting, developing and improving environmental reporting. Originality&#x2F;value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first to apply SA to environmental disclosure via SM in the public sphere. The study links modern techniques in natural language processing and machine learning with the important aspects of environmental communication between LGOs and citizens. © 2020, Laura Rocca, Davide Giacomini and Paola Zola.</abstract>

      <abstract>Nowadays, medical attention in the public sector is very deficient; it maintains a too-old system, which is a great obstacle and does not allow fast and optimal work. That is why when providing patient care, the response time and analysis takes between 3 to 6 months depending on the availability of people in service; this is increasingly complicated because people do not have adequate service, and attention to a diagnosed disease can even last longer because the resolution andmedical appointments to the specialty also go through the same process. The main reason to develop a mobile application is to achieve the correct patient care management. For this, we used the Scrum methodology that gives us a correct order,scalable progress, and, above all, constant communication between all team participants. We also used different technologies which will allow the implementation and development of the mobile application, especially to help improve medical care. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®</abstract>

      <abstract>The absolute majority of publications about changes in higher education resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic focus on the problems faced by students. They fail to articulate the position of university faculty members who are concerned about their dwindling role as a result of the digital transformation of education. Since 2020, the Institute of Social Analysis and Forecasting at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration with the support of the Russian Ministry of Science and Higher Education has conducted a monitoring study of the attitude of university faculty members to the changes taking place in higher education. The present article is based on the results of three research waves (non-random, administrative, two-stream samples) conducted in April 2020 (N &#x3D; 33,987), June-July 2020 (N &#x3D; 27,484) and April-May 2021 (N &#x3D; 26,334). An overall positive trend is observed in teacher attitudes: the peak of discontent about the introduction of distance education has passed, and the attitude to online learning has become calmer and more level-headed. Most teachers continue to express unconditional support for traditional in-person learning, however. The article takes a close look at the attitude of teachers to the digital transformation of higher education and analyzes their narratives. Teachers believe that the most promising aspect of the digital transformation of universities is the use of blended learning technologies that combine the benefits of classical and innovative teaching methods. The article identifies risk factors and further opportunities for digital innovations in higher education. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>Clean air in cities improves our health and overall quality of life and helps fight climate change and preserve our environment. High-resolution measures of pollutants’ concentrations can support the identification of urban areas with poor air quality and raise citizens’ awareness while encouraging more sustainable behaviors. Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technology have led to extensive use of low-cost air quality sensors for hyper-local air quality monitoring. As a result, public administrations and citizens increasingly rely on information obtained from sensors to make decisions in their daily lives and mitigate pollution effects. Unfortunately, in most sensing applications, sensors are known to be error-prone. Thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, it is possible to devise computationally efficient methods that can automatically pinpoint anomalies in those data streams in real time. In order to enhance the reliability of air quality sensing applications, we believe that it is highly important to set up a data-cleaning process. In this work, we propose AIrSense, a novel AI-based framework for obtaining reliable pollutant concentrations from raw data collected by a network of low-cost sensors. It enacts an anomaly detection and repairing procedure on raw measurements before applying the calibration model, which converts raw measurements to concentration measurements of gasses. There are very few studies of anomaly detection in raw air quality sensor data (millivolts). Our approach is the first that proposes to detect and repair anomalies in raw data before they are calibrated by considering the temporal sequence of the measurements and the correlations between different sensor features. If at least some previous measurements are available and not anomalous, it trains a model and uses the prediction to repair the observations; otherwise, it exploits the previous observation. Firstly, a majority voting system based on three different algorithms detects anomalies in raw data. Then, anomalies are repaired to avoid missing values in the measurement time series. In the end, the calibration model provides the pollutant concentrations. Experiments conducted on a real dataset of 12,000 observations produced by 12 low-cost sensors demonstrated the importance of the data-cleaning process in improving calibration algorithms’ performances. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The article examines the introduction of automated systems and
artificial intelligence (AI) in determining the credibility of
applicants for international protection in Germany. To this end, it
focuses on the examina-tion of two instruments, namely the extraction
and evaluation of data contained in the electronic devices of asylum
seekers, and the linguistic analysis performed by a piece of software
capable of establishing the most likely country of origin of the
applicant. Addressing German doctrine and jurisprudence, the article may
serve the purpose of exploring, from the standpoint of asylum law, the
tension between objectivity and efficiency of decisions in the public
sector and the protection of fundamental rights.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public sector institutions that consult citizens to inform decision-making face the challenge of evaluating the contributions made by citizens. This evaluation has important democratic implications but at the same time, consumes substantial human resources. However, until now the use of artificial intelligence such as computer-supported text analysis has remained an under-studied solution to this problem. We identify three generic tasks in the evaluation process that could benefit from natural language processing (NLP). Based on a systematic literature search in two databases on computational linguistics and digital government, we provide a detailed review of existing methods and their performance. While some promising approaches exist, for instance to group data thematically and to detect arguments and opinions, we show that there remain important challenges before these could offer any reliable support in practice. These include the quality of results, the appli- cability to non-English language corpuses and making algorithmic models available to practitioners through software. We discuss a number of avenues that future research should pursue that can ultimately lead to solutions for practice. The most promising of these bring in the expertise of human evaluators, for example through active learning approaches or interactive topic modeling.

      <abstract>The conceptualization of transparency in different perspectives could bring legal certainty to the design of opening of the State’s engine room. For this reason, in this descriptive work, emerging doctrinal dimensions are defined that could contribute to the legal regime of open government as well as processes to improve trust, efficiency, and effectiveness by means of technological applications and public sector. A multilevel conceptual map with a double dimension on transparency has been proposed; as a fundamental right and, at the same time, a legal principle of the open government regime in accordance with the digital transformation processes of the public sector and accordance with the fourth industrial revolution. By way of conclusion, its dualistic legal concretion is recommended because it enables to recognize the right to transparency as a democratic imperative to face opportunities and challenges of any political, economic, and legal aspects. In addition, it could be the framework for the unification of the regimen of automated administrative decision systems, the treatment of large data sets, and, in a futuristic perspective, other possible solutions provided by artificial intelligence based on accessibility to open data in the policy design process even though the problems of privacy of its implementation. © (2023), (Universidad Austral de Chile).

      <abstract>This article explores a sample of the literature on transparency in the 1984-2020 period through a systematic review. The sample consists of 242 works (articles, books, and book chapters) collected from different academic databases. Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) probabilistic topic modelling – an unsupervised machine learning approach – is employed in order to classify and construct a typology of topics within the literature. This approach is complemented by a structured overview of the varieties of transparency framework and is aimed at addressing three research questions: a) What analytical approaches are identified in the literature? b) How is transparency conceptualised through such analytical approaches? And, c) where has transparency’s focus been placed in relation to an event-process framework? The findings show unequal methodological approaches, topics, and issues investigated. These insights and the novel approach utilised outline key challenges and opportunities for future transparency research. © 2023 The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>Over the past few decades, Sweden has established itself as a “world leader” in gender equality. Alongside this development, Swedish politicians have also initiated ambitious plans that aim to establish the country as “world class” in terms of digitalization. International research shows that women and racialized groups are in a minority in the design processes, that AI facial recognition systems are built with white male faces as the norm, and that digital tools replicate racial injustices. In this paper, we are interested in if, and if so how, gender equality is articulated and thus filled with meaning in national policies on AI and digitalization. The overall aim is to discuss the potential of gender (equality) mainstreaming to challenge systems of privilege in the implementation of AI systems in the public sector. The paper analyses how gender equality is filled with meaning in national policy documents on AI and gender equality. The main findings show that gender equality is turned into a question of lack of knowledge and information, which in turn blocks out an understanding of gender equality as something that is related to gendered power relations. © 2023 The Authors.

      <abstract>Nowadays, the European municipal waste management policy based on the
circular economy paradigm demands the closing of material and financial
loops at all territorial levels of public administration. The effective
planning of treatment capacities (especially sorting plants, recycling,
and energy recovery facilities) and municipal waste management policy
requires an accurate prognosis of municipal waste generation, and
therefore, the knowledge of behavioral, socio-economic, and demographic
factors influencing the waste management (and recycling) behavior of
households, and other municipal waste producers. To enable public bodies
at different territorial levels to undertake an effective action
resulting in circular economy we evaluated various factors influencing
the generation of municipal waste fractions at regional, micro-regional
and municipal level in the Czech Republic. Principal components were
used as input for traditional models (multivariable linear regression,
generalized linear model) as well as tree-based machine learning models
(regression trees, random forest, gradient boosted regression trees).
Study results suggest that the linear regression model usually offers a
good trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability. When the
most important goal of the prediction is supposed to be accuracy, the
random forest is generally the best choice. The quality of developed
models depends mostly on the chosen territorial level and municipal
waste fraction. The performance of these models deteriorates
significantly for lower territorial levels because of worse data quality
and bigger variability. Only the age structure seems to be important
across territorial levels and municipal waste fractions. Nevertheless,
also other factors are of high significance in explaining the generation
of municipal waste fractions at different territorial levels (e.g.
number of economic subjects, expenditures, population density and the
level of education). Therefore, there is not one single effective public
policy dealing with circular economy strategy that fits all territorial
levels. Public representatives should focus on policies effective at
specific territorial level. However, performance of the models is poor
for lower territorial levels (municipality and micro-regions). Thus,
results for municipalities and microregions are weak and should be
treated as such.</abstract>

      <abstract>Groundwater contamination derived from human activities including farming is a serious problem threatening water security in the Northern Province (NP) of Sri Lanka. Gathering all existing research knowledge on the province&#39;s water resource base to create a digital repository is a key action in the 3-year action research project on water security. Papers gathered in the repository showed that water quality, particularly salinity in groundwater and its contamination, was a prominent theme in research over the past two decades. Thus, the scope of this bibliometric study is restricted to published work on water quality pertaining to the North during 1969–2021. Publications listed in four electronic databases, namely, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar yielded 118 scholarly publications. This paper provides an overview of the publication types and distribution, titles of journals and conferences, authorship, institutions, countries, themes, and keywords used. Final 20 years of study period saw a substantial growth in publication rate of water quality papers in the NP with journal articles and conference papers being the dominant types at 63% and 35%, respectively. Authors from 52 different institutions contributed to production of these publications, 93% of whom represented public sector institutions in Sri Lanka. University of Jaffna was in the lead position in numeric terms (n &#x3D; 82), followed by the University of Peradeniya (n &#x3D; 28). A significant 81% of the papers accounted for studies on water contamination, some indication of the degree of concern for this aspect among the research community. Around 65% of papers have been published in a wide range of international journals, some of which are less well established. This tendency has implications for the scientific output in terms of its quality, peer review process, and in turn also for usefulness of the work in the local context and in policy making. © 2023 Policy Studies Organization.</abstract>

      <abstract>The smart city concept brings together technology, government and
different layers of society, utilizing technological enablers, such as
the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). These
enablers, in turn, facilitate development of various aspects of the
smart city including, e.g., transportation, governance, education,
safety and communications. However, the transition towards smarter
cities involves not only technological development but also the changing
and evolving roles of citizens, service providers and city authorities.
In this transition, the key issue is creating and growing roles of
collaboration, participation and coordination. Whereas mainstream
research focuses on smart city transformation in big cities, aspects of
this transformation in the context of small cities has been a widely
neglected topic. This paper presents three cases of smart city
development in small cities in Finland, each concentrating on a
different aspect of smart city development. The cases reveal how a
relatively small-sized city may take remarkable steps in smart city
development by selecting a specific theme on which to build smart city
activities. These examples also emphasize the critical role of public
sector actors, showing that the public sector has a key role in creating
the foundations for fruitful ecosystem-based development work.</abstract>

      <abstract>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018.
After this enforcement, many fines have already been imposed by national
data protection authorities in Europe. This paper examines the
individual GDPR articles referenced in the enforcement decisions, as
well as predicts the amount of enforcement fines with available
meta-data and text mining features extracted from the enforcement
decision documents. According to the results, three articles related to
the general principles, lawfulness, and information security have been
the most frequently referenced ones. Although the amount of fines
imposed vary across the articles referenced, these three particular
articles do not stand out. Furthermore, a better statistical evidence is
available with other meta-data features, including information about the
particular European countries in which the enforcements were made.
Accurate predictions are attainable even with simple machine learning
techniques for regression analysis. Basic text mining features
outperform the meta-data features in this regard. In addition to these
results, the paper reflects the GDPR&#39;s enforcement against public
administration obstacles in the European Union (EU), as well as
discusses the use of automatic decision-making systems in judiciary.

      <abstract>The advancement and continuous development of information and
communication technologies highlights the importance of analysing and
monitoring the development and capabilities of governments to use and
exploit the potential of new technologies. Digital government and
artificial intelligence in the public sector are two trends associated
with technological development. This research conducts an analysis of
these elements from the perspective of public officials by conducting a
factor analysis. The study is based on a survey administered to civil
servants in the state of Jalisco in Mexico. An analysis was made of
their training and knowledge of these aspects and whether there are
significant differences according to gender, age, level of studies, area
of knowledge and place of work. The results obtained show divergences
and coincidences between variables and factors. The findings are useful
as a reference for the government of Jalisco to promote measures aimed
at improving the situation of digital government and artificial
intelligence in the short to medium term, in order to optimize
administrative management. Points for practitioners Knowing the
perspective of public officials on digital government and artificial
intelligence is important to evaluate and design a digital strategy in
governments. Public officials in charge of technology areas in
governments need constant training on emerging technological tools,
mainly those related to artificial intelligence. There is a lack of
knowledge about the use and implications of artificial intelligence in
the public sector by public servants. Data interoperability and
coordination between government agencies are relevant to the development
of digital government.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a technological development is being
implemented in the public sector with the intention of improving service
delivery, as well as to help solve complex problems. However, there is a
wide range of capabilities that AI can perform and that public officials
perceive and implement in different ways. This paper aims to describe
and analyze some categories into which AI capabilities in the public
sector are divided. Using an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), our
results show that the capabilities of AI from the perspective of public
officials can be classified into two aspects: systematic factors and
axiological factors. Systematic factors are related to the analysis and
behavior of data, including monitoring, analyzing, interacting,
remembering, and anticipation. Axiological factors refer to the impacts
of values, ethics, and decisions, including acting, feeling, moralizing,
creating, and deciding capacities. This categorization of AI
capabilities in the public sector sheds light on the perception of
public officials about the implementation of this technological
development.</abstract>

      <abstract>This exploratory study aims to assess and investigate Brunei Darussalam’s readiness in developing and applying big data technologies for its public and private sectors, using the social, technological, environmental, and policy (STEP) framework. The results show that the population are digitally literate (social) and utilise smart devices as well as internet network connectivity that is widely offered by the local telecommunications company (technology). The government of Brunei Darussalam established multiple digital transformation initiatives including implementation of 5G connectivity as well as digital economy masterplan to digitally transformed in the near future (environment). Regardless of the absence of national digital data privacy policy (policy) in Brunei, the recent nation’s successful big data application in public sector—BruHealth Application—to contain COVID-19 community spread was achieved. The existence of such policy in the near future will create opportunities for the local private sectors to capitalise on big data technologies to their business strategies. © 2022 Authors.

      <abstract>Background: In the broader healthcare domain, the prediction bears more value than an explanation considering the cost of delays in its services. There are various risk prediction models for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in the literature for early risk assessment. However, the substantial increase in CVDs-related mortality is challenging global health systems, especially in developing countries. This situation allows researchers to improve CVDs prediction models using new features and risk computing methods. This study aims to assess nonclinical features that can be easily available in any healthcare systems, in predicting CVDs using advanced and flexible machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: A gender-matched case–control study was conducted in the largest public sector cardiac hospital of Pakistan, and the data of 460 subjects were collected. The dataset comprised of eight nonclinical features. Four supervised ML algorithms were used to train and test the models to predict the CVDs status by considering traditional logistic regression (LR) as the baseline model. The models were validated through the train–test split (70:30) and tenfold cross-validation approaches. Results: Random forest (RF), a nonlinear ML algorithm, performed better than other ML algorithms and LR. The area under the curve (AUC) of RF was 0.851 and 0.853 in the train–test split and tenfold cross-validation approach, respectively. The nonclinical features yielded an admissible accuracy (minimum 71%) through the LR and ML models, exhibiting its predictive capability in risk estimation. Conclusion: The satisfactory performance of nonclinical features reveals that these features and flexible computational methodologies can reinforce the existing risk prediction models for better healthcare services. © 2021, International Association of Scientists in the Interdisciplinary Areas.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: The main goal of this research work is the optimization of the purchasing business process in the Moroccan public sector in terms of transparency and budgetary optimization. The authors have worked on the public university as an implementation field. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: The design of the research work followed the design science research (DSR) methodology for information systems. DSR is a research paradigm wherein a designer answers questions relevant to human problems through the creation of innovative artifacts, thereby contributing new knowledge to the body of scientific evidence. The authors have adopted a techno-functional approach. The technical part consists of the development of an intelligent recommendation system that supports the choice of optimal information technology (IT) equipment for decision-makers. This intelligent recommendation system relies on a set of functional and business concepts, namely the Moroccan normative laws and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology&#39;s (COBIT) guidelines in information system governance. Findings: The modeling of business processes in public universities is established using business process model and notation (BPMN) in accordance with official regulations. The set of BPMN models constitute a powerful repository not only for business process execution but also for further optimization. Governance generally aims to reduce budgetary wastes, and the authors&#39; recommendation system demonstrates a technical and methodological approach enabling this feature. Implementation of artificial intelligence techniques can bring great value in terms of transparency and fluidity in purchasing business process execution. Research limitations&#x2F;implications: Business limitations: First, the proposed system was modeled to handle one type products, which are computer-related equipment. Hence, the authors intend to extend the model to other types of products in future works. Conversely, the system proposes optimal purchasing order and assumes that decision makers will rely on this optimal purchasing order to choose between offers. In fact, as a perspective, the authors plan to work on a complete automation of the workflow to also include vendor selection and offer validation. Technical limitations: Natural language processing (NLP) is a widely used sentiment analysis (SA) technique that enabled the authors to validate the proposed system. Even working on samples of datasets, the authors noticed NLP dependency on huge computing power. The authors intend to experiment with learning and knowledge-based SA and assess the&#39; computing power consumption and accuracy of the analysis compared to NLP. Another technical limitation is related to the web scraping technique; in fact, the users&#39; reviews are crucial for the authors&#39; system. To guarantee timeliness and reliable reviews, the system has to look automatically in websites, which confront the authors with the limitations of the web scraping like the permanent changing of website structure and scraping restrictions. Practical implications: The modeling of business processes in public universities is established using BPMN in accordance with official regulations. The set of BPMN models constitute a powerful repository not only for business process execution but also for further optimization. Governance generally aims to reduce budgetary wastes, and the authors&#39; recommendation system demonstrates a technical and methodological approach enabling this feature. Originality&#x2F;value: The adopted techno-functional approach enabled the authors to bring information system governance from a highly abstract level to a practical implementation where the theoretical best practices and guidelines are transformed to a tangible application. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>This manuscript critically examines the adoption of generative AI tools,
notably ChatGPT and Bard, within public administration research,
especially in street-level bureaucracy. While these tools offer
revolutionary insights into bureaucratic behaviors and decision-making,
they pose significant ethical dilemmas, including potential biases and
data privacy concerns. The paper offers comprehensive recommendations
designed to help researchers navigate these challenges, emphasizing the
need for robust data validation, enhanced transparency, and continuous
adherence to evolving ethical standards. The overarching aim is to
facilitate responsible AI integration, ensuring research methodologies&#39;
efficacy and preserving ethical integrity in public administration
inquiries.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is one of the important statistical methods that are widely used in a range of applications in various fields, which simulates the work of the human brain in terms of receiving a signal, processing data in a human cell and sending to the next cell. It is a system consisting of a number of modules (layers) linked together (input, hidden, output). A comparison was made between three types of neural networks (Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Back propagation network (BPL), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). he study found that the lowest false prediction rate was for the recurrentt network architecture and using the Data on graduate students at the College of Administration and Economics, University of Baghdad for the period from 2014-2015 to The academic year 2017-2018. The variables are use in the research is (student’s success, age, gender, job, type of study (higher diploma, master’s, doctorate), specialization (statistics, economics, accounting, industry management, administrative management, and public administration) and channel acceptance). It became clear that the best variables that affect the success of graduate students are the type of study, age and job. © The Author 2022.

      <abstract>The problem that is solved in the research is to increase the efficiency of decision making in management tasks while ensuring the given reliability, regardless of the hierarchy of the system. The object of the research is the decision making support system in the field of democratic civilian control over the security and defense sector (FDCCSDS). The subject of research is the decision making process in management tasks using fuzzy cognitive maps and evolving artificial neural networks. The hypothesis of the research is to increase the number of sources of information about the components of the FDCCSDS, with restrictions on the efficiency and reliability of decision making. The research proposed a method for evaluating the information and analytical provision of public administration in FDCCSDS. It was established that the proposed method has a higher efficiency compared to the known ones by an average of 40 %, compared to the methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of strategic management decisions. The specified method will make it possible to assess the state of information and analytical provision of public administration in the FDCCSDS and to determine effective measures to improve efficiency. The method will allow to analyze possible options for the development of FDCCSDS in each phase of development and moments in time when it is necessary to carry out structural changes that ensure the transition to the next phase. At the same time, subjective factors of choice are taken into account while searching for solutions, which are formalized in the form of weighting coefficients for the components of the integral criterion of efficiency. The specified method allows to increase the speed of assessment of the state of information and analytical support of the FDCCSDS, to reduce the use of computing resources of and decision making support systems, to form measures aimed at increasing the efficiency of information and analytical support © 2023, Authors.

      <abstract>Importance: Responding to the opioid crisis requires tools to identify individuals at risk of overdose. Given the expansion of illicit opioid deaths, it is essential to consider risk factors across multiple service systems. Objective: To develop a predictive risk model to identify opioid overdose using linked clinical and criminal justice data. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional sample was created using 2015 data from 4 Maryland databases: All-payer hospital discharges, the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), public-sector specialty behavioral treatment, and criminal justice records for property or drug-associated offenses. Maryland adults aged 18 to 80 years with records in any of 4 databases were included, excluding individuals who died in 2015 or had a non-Maryland zip code. Logistic regression models were estimated separately for risk of fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose in 2016. Model performance was assessed using bootstrapping. Data analysis took place from February 2018 to November 2019. Exposures: Controlled substance prescription fills and hospital, specialty behavioral health, or criminal justice encounters. Main Outcomes and Measures: Fatal opioid overdose defined by the state medical examiner and 1 or more nonfatal overdoses treated in Maryland hospitals during 2016. Results: There were 2294707 total individuals in the sample, of whom 42.3% were male (n &#x3D; 970019) and 53.0% were younger than 50 years (647083 [28.2%] aged 18-34 years and 568160 [24.8%] aged 35-49 years). In 2016, 1204 individuals (0.05%) in the sample experienced fatal opioid overdose and 8430 (0.37%) experienced nonfatal opioid overdose. In adjusted analysis, the factors mostly strongly associated with fatal overdose were male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.40 [95% CI, 2.08-2.76]), diagnosis of opioid use disorder in a hospital (OR, 2.93 [95% CI, 2.17-3.80]), release from prison in 2015 (OR, 4.23 [95% CI, 2.10-7.11]), and receiving opioid addiction treatment with medication (OR, 2.81 [95% CI, 2.20-3.86]). Similar associations were found for nonfatal overdose. The area under the curve for fatal overdose was 0.82 for a model with hospital variables, 0.86 for a model with both PDMP and hospital variables, and 0.89 for a model that further added behavioral health and criminal justice variables. For nonfatal overdose, the area under the curve using all variables was 0.85. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis, fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose could be accurately predicted with linked administrative databases. Hospital encounter data had higher predictive utility than PDMP data. Model performance was meaningfully improved by adding PDMP records. Predictive models using linked databases can be used to target large-scale public health programs.. © 2020 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>In the context of the digital transformation of the European economy and society, new technologies have emerged bringing new opportunities for the benefit of citizens, public administrations and businesses. One of these is the Blockchain-based smart contracts rooted in what is known as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). This article aims to provide an overview of how DLTs could be successfully implemented in the governance of public procurement, as well as discussing some legal challenges that might appear. Taking into account the proof of concept of all the existing projects in this field, DLTs promise to provide procuring with a high level of transparency, integrity, autonomy, and overall speed-up procurement cycles. While the architecture of a Blockchain-based public procurement scheme is constrained by the immaturity of the technology, it is observed that the establishment of private ledgers (or public-permissioned ledgers) in tender procedures might be more suitable to public procurement. Although the process of implementation might be costly and less feasible in comparison with other fields in the public sector, initiatives focusing on this area should be endorsed. Ultimately, the successful implementation of DLTs in the governance of public procurement is inconceivable without a far-reaching professionalisation of procurement practitioners. © 2019, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

      <abstract>As part of its &#x60;pro-innovation&#39; approach to artificial intelligence
(AI), the UK has left public sector AI procurement and deployment to
&#x60;regulation by contract&#39; based on thin guidance. Borrowing from the
description of AI &#x60;hallucinations&#39; as plausible but incorrect answers
given with high confidence by AI systems, I argue that this is a
&#x60;regulatory hallucination&#39;: an incorrect answer to the challenge of
regulating the procurement and use of AI by the public sector. The
pretence that public buyers can &#x60;confidently and responsibly procure AI
technologies&#39; can generate individual harms and broader negative social
effects as the public sector ramps up AI adoption and accumulates a
potentially significant stock of AI deployments across all areas of
public sector activity. I sketch an alternative strategy to boost the
effectiveness of the goals of AI regulation and the protection of
individual rights and collective interests through the creation of an
independent authority.</abstract>

      <abstract>The core of sustainable public procurement lies in its ability to stem
uneconomical public expenditures that waste taxpayer money and stifle
social trust and development. The external audit of public procurement
proves problematic since current research fails to provide sufficient
empirical studies aimed at identifying procurement fraud. The
development of online portals with embedded e-procurement solutions,
along with the big data revolution, open new horizons and allow us to
reveal trends otherwise impossible to spot, such as transactions
achieved in an exclusive commercial relationship, in which a vendor
engages only with a single public entity. By using innovative data
acquisition techniques, our research encompasses 2.25 million online
direct public procurement procedures conducted in 2023 using the
Romanian portal for public procurement, totaling EUR 3.22 billion. By
aggregating databases obtained from various public sources, our analysis
achieved remarkable granularity, using over 112 million data elements-50
pertaining to each transaction. Research results indicate a unique
sub-population of public procurement procedures-those conducted with
&#x60;&#x60;in-house&#39;&#39; vendors totaling 14.28% of all direct public
acquisitions and which is significantly differentiated along the entire
list of analyzed criteria-financial, geographical, statistical, or
risk-wise-illustrating a troubling phenomenon: possible gerrymandering
of the online public procurement landscape, which, at least in theory,
resembles a perfect market, by cultivating preferential commercial
relations, thus affecting the legality, regularity, and economical
aspects of public procurement.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are already transforming our world socially, economically and politically and are part of our everyday lives, most of the time in invisible ways. In this paper, I offer some reflections on the possible effects that the ‘AI turn’ of global governance has for human rights practices, particularly in the case of the United Nations. This turn, under the banner ‘AI for good’, is expressed in the UN&#39;s intervention in major crises and continues with the creation of more mundane policies and law. The paper also shows that, beyond the policy and crisis-intervention orientations of AI, we are witnessing the creation of new foundations for human belonging and being. Algorithmic interpretation and computational calculation contribute to the definition of the reality of intervention and to the institutional production of data identities and data realities that are part of digital humanity. All this is taking place through the automatization of decision making in the context of the increased interdependence between private and public sectors. © 2021 The Authors.

      <abstract>Technologies based on artificial intelligence (AI) can radically change
the existing political paradigm, empowering more diffused forms of
political participation beyond elections-especially in the emergent
worldwide context of unrestricted disclosure of governmental data
online. The objective of this research is to investigate how civil
society can use AI-based technologies to empower political
participation. A sample of 721 publications was conducted through a
combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic review, which
revealed the characteristics and the nascent state of literature. This
was followed by an exploratory Case Study, conducted through in-depth
interviews and participant observation and supplemented by secondary
materials. The content of the Case Study was extensively and
systematically analysed through textual coding. We depicted a framework
of how civil society can use AI-based technologies to nurture diffused
political participation. This framework scrutinizes six focal areas and
their respective dominant traits and descriptive features, aiming at
contributing to guiding academic studies and political endeavours.</abstract>

      <abstract>PurposeThis study aims to estimate the value of the impact from digital
transformation (DX) focusing on its automation effect, looking at the
time and cost savings coming from the substitution effect with an
adoption of digital technologies. For example, cloud and artificial
intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT have the potential to change
ways of working, substituting and replacing several of the tasks that
are currently carried out by public administration (PA) employees and
labor processes underpinning PA services.Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approachThe
paper outlines a new framework to estimate the potential impact of DX on
the public sector. The authors apply this framework to estimate the
value of the impact of DX on the Italian PA, defining the latter by the
collection of the value of its labor (i.e. PA workforce salaries) and by
the collection of the value of its outputs (i.e. public services&#39;
costs).FindingsThis study ultimately maps out the magnitude and trends
of how likely the PA occupations and services could be substituted in a
wider process of DX. To do this, the authors apply their framework to
the Italian PA, and they triangulate secondary data collection, from
official accounts of the Italian Ministry of Economics and the National
Statistical Institute, with methodological antecedents from the UK
Office for National Statistics and experts&#39; insights. Results provide a
snapshot on the type and magnitude of PA jobs and services projected to
be affected by automation over the next 10 years.Originality&#x2F;valueTo the
best of the authors&#39; knowledge, this paper provides for the first time
an approach to estimate the value of the impact of DX on the public
sector in a data-constrained environment - or in the lack of the
required primary data. Once applied to the Italian PA, this approach
provides a granular map of the automatability of each of the PA
occupations and of the PA services. Finally, this paper mentions
preliminary insights on potential challenges related to equity in public
sector jobs and implications on recruitment processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper explores citizens&#39; stances toward the use of artificial
intelligence (AI) in public services in Norway. Utilizing a social
contract perspective, the study analyzes the government-citizen
relationship at macro, meso, and micro levels. A prototype of an AI
-enabled public welfare service was designed and presented to 20
participants who were interviewed to investigate their stances on the
described AI use. We found a generally positive attitude and identified
three factors contributing to this: (a) the high level of trust in
government (macro level); (b) the balanced value proposition between
individual and collective needs (meso level); and (c) the reassurance
provided by having humans in the loop and providing transparency into
processes, data, and model&#39;s logic (microlevel). The findings provide
valuable insights into citizens&#39; stances for socially responsible AI in
public services. These insights can inform policy and guide the design
and implementation of AI systems in the public sector by foregrounding
the government-citizen relationship. Policy Significance Statement As
artificial intelligence (AI) technology evolves, it holds great
potential for enhancing public service delivery. But citizen concerns
underscore the need for responsibility and diligence in the public
sector. To understand citizen perspectives on AI use in Norwegian public
services, we examined a public welfare case and analyzed the results
through a social contract theory lens. This perspective considers
government-citizen relationships at multiple levels. We found three key
factors driving positive citizen views of AI: (1) high government trust
(macro level); (2) balancing individual and collective needs (meso
level); and (3) confidence in human oversight and transparent processes,
data, and model logic (microlevel). Our insights can guide policymakers
in responsibly integrating AI for the benefit of both individuals and
society.</abstract>

      <abstract>The @ is the link between the name of the recipient and its address. The e-mail has revolutionized the communication behavior. It represents a new era of information and data exchange. The speed of information exchange and the possibility of non-physical data transport have fundamentally changed human communication. Big Data has become the synonym for a new technological age. Generally Big Data collects data and delivers valuable and useful information (Baron, 2013, 1). A general definition of the term has not yet taken place in science and practice. The work of the public sector is based on the collection, identification and use of data in many areas. Public organizations are often data monopolists and the only provider of public goods. The acquisition of new information in the sense of Big Data requires a connection between existing data and the use of new information. This gives the public administration a whole new potential. The organizational function &quot;Controlling&quot; supports decision-makers in the context of management and control (Horváth, 2011, 16). The proximity of Big Data and Controlling is obvious. This article describes the potentials resulting from the use of Big Data and its effects on Public Controlling. Big Data will revolutionize Public Controlling and thus the public administration as a whole.</abstract>

      <abstract>This contribution analyses the German legal framework concerning automated decision-making systems. Public administration in Germany uses automated decision-making systems primarily to adopt partially or fully automated administrative acts. Accordingly, this paper focuses on automated administrative acts, however, it also discusses the first comprehensive regulation of artificial intelligence enacted by a German “Bundesland”. The paper approaches the topic from three different perspectives: The German legislative framework, case-law and soft-law concerning automated decision-making systems. © 2023, Universita degli Studi di Milano.

      <abstract>Self-driving cars (also known as driverless cars, autonomous vehicles,
and highly automated vehicles [HAVs]) will change the regulatory,
political, and ethical frameworks surrounding motor vehicles. At the
highest levels of automation, HAVs are operated by independent machine
agents, making decisions without the direct intervention of humans. The
current transportation system assumes human intervention though,
including legal and moral responsibilities of human operators. Has the
development of these artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous system
(AS) technologies outpaced the ethical and political conversations? This
paper examines discussions of HAVs, driver responsibility, and
technology failure to highlight the differences between how the
policy-making institutions in the United States (Congress and the Public
Administration) and technology and transportation experts are or are not
speaking about responsibility in the context of autonomous systems
technologies. We report findings from a big data analysis of
corpus-level documents to find that enthusiasm for HAVs has outpaced
other discussions of the technology.</abstract>

      <abstract>This case study examines the experience of the interdisciplinary Measuring the Effects of Catch Shares (MECS) project, a five-year demonstration project designed to explore the opportunities and constraints for third-party acquisition, organization, and communication of government fisheries statistics in order to track the ecological, economic, social, and governance outcomes of catch share programs. Catch share programs, whereby fishery managers allocate to private entities percentages of the total amount of fish that can be caught in a year, have been used to manage some US fisheries since the 1990s. Given the high financial stakes of commercial fisheries and the wide-ranging impacts ascribed to these programs, they are among the most controversial and contentious tools of contemporary fisheries management. The goal of the MECS project was to create an interactive, web-based platform for conveying a set of neutral, scientific indicators based on the best available fisheries data that could be used by fishing industry participants, fishery managers, and other interested parties to supplement and inform their own understanding of catch share program effects. The MECS project focused on the effects of two US catch share programs: the Northeast Multispecies Sector Program implemented in 2010 in the Northeast groundfish fishery and the Shorebased IFQ Program implemented in 2011 in the West Coast groundfish trawl fishery. The MECS project encountered data access challenges but ultimately succeeded in developing a website that has been received by members of the private and public sector alike as a useful tool that brings together and communicates disparate information that is not otherwise readily accessible. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>The importance of today&#39;s public sector delivering citizen-centric
services enabled by technology is well recognized. To deliver such
services, the public sector is turning to artificial intelligence, and
in particular virtual agents (VA). This research examines how citizens
gain value from interacting with VAs in a public sector setting. Through
empirical research, utilizing transcripts from citizens&#39; interactions
with a VA, four dimensions of value-in-use were identified. This adds to
the theoretical body of knowledge on value co-creation in public service
settings and provides practical insights into how citizens use VAs and
possible avenues for future investment and improvements.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study examines the features and benefits of a collaborative online-course template designed for and used by the department of public administration program at a mid-Atlantic university in the USA. Drawing on a multi-informant original survey addressed to students and faculty the study aims to answer the question: to what extent are online-course templates beneficial to student learning and instructor teaching experiences? Findings suggest that, overall, both students and faculty had positive perceptions of the template’s consistency in terms of format and access, but students found the template to be more beneficial to their learning than did faculty to their teaching. © The Author(s) 2019.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve public
governance, but the use of AI in public organizations remains limited.
In this qualitative study, we explore how public organizations
strategically manage the adoption of AI. Managing AI adoption in the
public sector is complex because of the inherent tension between public
organizations&#39; identity, characterized by formal and rigid structures,
and the demands of AI innovation that require experimentation and
flexibility. Our findings show that public organizations navigate this
tension either by creating separate departments for data science teams,
or by integrating data science teams into already existing operational
departments. The case studies reveal that separation improves the
technical expertise and capabilities of the organization, whereas
integration improves the alignment between AI and primary processes. The
findings also show that both approaches are characterized by different
AI adoption barriers. We empirically identify the processes and routines
public organizations develop to overcome these barriers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public organisations increasingly rely on machine learning algorithms in
performing many of their core activities. It is therefore important to
consider how algorithms are transforming the public sector. This article
aims to clarify this by assessing algorithms from a public value
perspective. Based on a discussion of the literature, it is demonstrated
that algorithms are generally expected to strengthen organisational
performance on a first cluster of values related to the ability to be
effective and efficient (sigma values). At the same time, the use of
algorithms is linked to negatively affect a second cluster of values
that involves fairness and transparency (theta values). In the current
academic debate, little attention is given to an important third cluster
of values: the ability of organisations to be adaptive and robust
(lambda values). This discussion highlights that algorithms invoke
public value opportunities, but also public value risks and trade-offs.
This article therefore presents five principles for managing algorithms
from a public value perspective.</abstract>

      <abstract>Thermal imaging systems are harmless to human health and enable contactless heat measurements. The thermal cameras are used in many public sectors where it is necessary to detect the change of temperature values. However, thermal cameras are costly and produce images with low edge information. This situation prevents the widespread use of thermal cameras. Therefore, in recent years, the researches to advance the quality of thermal images have increased. Within the scope of the studies in this paper, first of all, three different datasets consisting of thermal images in the colourful format of neonates were created. Also, TSRGAN+ deep network model was presented for super-resolution studies. The super-resolution images obtained visually approached ground truth images to a great extent. In addition, these results were compared using the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) image quality metrics. The proposed model showed a superior success in terms of the values of PSNR and SSIM compared to the state-of-the-art models. Here, the PSNR value of the proposed TSRGAN+ model increased by 1–1.5 dB compared to the TSRGAN network architecture, while the SSIM value increased by around 2–3%. Finally, the unhealthy-healthy image classification applications were performed on all thermal image sets in order to implement both the task-based evaluation and a real-life application. Thus, a new method is presented to evaluate the results of the super-resolution studies. Here, firstly, a CNN-based classifier was designed and the classification metrics were obtained for all three datasets. Then, transfer learning was applied using state-of-the-art models (ResNet101, Xception) to increase classification success. Here, the most successful results were obtained in applications using the ResNet101 model. Also, the developed model outperformed the TSRGAN, which achieved the second-best result. When all the obtained results are evaluated, it has been observed that the super-resolution models increase the success of unhealthy-healthy classification by about 10% compared to the low resolution images. In other words, the effects of super-resolution techniques on classification applications are clearly seen. In summary, the logical use of the super-resolution research will enable the common use of low-cost thermal cameras in the application fields such as medicine. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>Nowadays, the Government as a Platform (GaaP) based on cloud computing
and network, has come to be considered a new structure to manage
efficiently data-driven administration in the public sector. When the
GaaP concept was first introduced, the ICT infrastructures that could
underpin GaaP were not sufficiently developed. However, the recent
digital transformation has transformed the previous electronic
government, which was system- and architecture-oriented. As part of the
next generation of government models, GaaP may reinvent the government
at a lower cost but with better performance, similar to the case of
electronic government two decades ago. This study attempted to determine
the priority of factors of GaaP by using the analytic hierarchy process
(AHP) methodology. Because of the GaaP characteristics, we drew the main
components for building GaaP from previous studies and a group interview
with experts. The study results show that experts tend to prefer
publicness in terms of building GaaP. Most of the factors that the
experts weighed with the highest importance are related to the public
sector, which revealed that governments should focus on their primary
duty, regardless of the origin and characteristics of the platform in
GaaP. However, since GaaP allows governments to be more horizontal and
innovative, the platform approach can fundamentally shift the existing
processes and culture of the public sector. The enhanced activity of
citizens with ICT can also accelerate the introduction of GaaP. Finally,
the study showed that a data-driven GaaP is necessary to efficiently
handle big data, contract services, and multiple levels of on-line and
off-line channels. In this public platform, government, citizens, and
private sector organizations can work cooperatively as partners to
seamlessly govern the hyper-connected society.</abstract>

      <abstract>At the current level of economic development, the digital transformation of society is an important factor in advancing any social structure. The purpose of the present study was to explore the transformation of a traditional society into a digital one, with a focus on ethical and environmental aspects. The study draws on a variety of information analysis methods to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of digitalization, including the environmental aspect. Our research revealed that in Russia, the only highly digitalized sectors were information technology and finance. Digitalization is strikingly different in the European countries, where only transport and building industries slowly implemented digital technologies into their business processes. We also examined digitalization levels in 7 Moscow universities. The universities managed to improve their digitalization scores with the help of recommendations developed for online learning, such as selection of quality software, having qualified teaching staff, constant monitoring, and evaluation of knowledge. The findings can be used in economic, social, and environmental spheres since they highlight the ambiguous effects of digitalization using practical examples. © The authors 2022.

      <abstract>The public sector, private firms, business community, and civil society
are generating data that are high in volume, veracity, and velocity and
come from a diversity of sources. This type of data is today known as
big data. Public administrations pursue big data as &#x60;&#x60;new oil&#39;&#39; and
implement data-centric policies to collect, generate, process, share,
exploit, and protect data for promoting good governance, transparency,
innovative digital services, and citizens&#39; engagement in public policy.
All of the above constitute the Government Big Data Ecosystem (GBDE).
Despite the great interest in this ecosystem, there is a lack of clear
definitions, the various important types of government data remain
vague, the different actors and their roles are not well defined, while
the impact in key public administration sectors is not yet deeply
understood and assessed. Such research and literature gaps impose a
crucial obstacle for a better understanding of the prospects and nascent
issues in exploiting GBDE. With this study, we aim to start filling the
above-mentioned gaps by organizing our findings from an extended
Systematic Literature Review into a framework to organise and address
the above-mentioned challenges. Our goal is to contribute in this
fast-evolving area by bringing some clarity and establishing common
understanding around key elements of the emerging GBDE.</abstract>

Method: The cross-sectional study was conducted at the medical and dental constituent institutes of Jinnah Sindh Medical University and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre between August and October 2023, and comprised undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students of either gender aged 18-40 years. Data was collected using a self-administered, structured, closed-ended 16-item questionnaire, which was developed in the English language and explored the usage of YouTube as a source of information about medical and dental clinical procedures. Data was coded and analysed using SPSS 26. Results: Of the 314 participants, 153(48.7%) were medical students and 161(51.3%) were from the dental stream, 175(55.7%) were females, and 139(44.3%) were males. YouTube was a helpful tool for 143(45.5%) students who used it when needed, 172(54.8%) used it occasionally before attempting procedures, while majority of the dental students 140(44.6%) used it to study for prosthodontics. There were 154(49%) students who supported the idea that faculty should recommend watching relevant videos on YouTube, while 256(81.5%) preferred other websites. Conclusion: YouTube was mostly used for learning clinical procedures by the students. © 2024 Pakistan Medical Association. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>The public sector, private firms, business community, and civil society are generating data that is high in volume, veracity, velocity and comes from a diversity of sources. This kind of data is known as big data. Public Administrations (PAs) pursue big data as “new oil” and implement data-centric policies to transform data into knowledge, to promote good governance, transparency, innovative digital services, and citizens’ engagement in public policy. From the above, the Government Big Data Ecosystem (GBDE) emerges. Managing big data throughout its lifecycle becomes a challenging task for governmental organizations. Despite the vast interest in this ecosystem, appropriate big data management is still a challenge. This study intends to fill the above-mentioned gap by proposing a data lifecycle framework for data-driven governments. Through a Systematic Literature Review, we identified and analysed 76 data lifecycles models to propose a data lifecycle framework for data-driven governments (DaliF). In this way, we contribute to the ongoing discussion around big data management, which attracts researchers’ and practitioners’ interest. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>This research highlights a contextual application for big data within a HR case study setting. This is achieved through the development of a normative conceptual model that seeks to envelop employee behaviors and attitudes in the context of organizational change readiness. This empirical application considers a data sample from a large public sector organization and through applying Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) identifies salary, job promotion, organizational loyalty and organizational identity influences on employee job satisfaction (suggesting and mediating employee readiness for organizational change). However in considering this specific context, the authors highlight how, where and why such a normative approach to employee factors may be limited and thus, proposes through a framework which brings together big data principles, implementation approaches and management commitment requirements can be applied and harnessed more effectively in order to assess employee attitudes and behaviors as part of wider HR predictive analytics (HRPA) approaches. The researchers conclude with a discussion on these research elements and a set of practical, conceptual and management implications of the findings along with recommendations for future research in the area. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>

      <abstract>There is enormous opportunity for positive social impact from the rise of algorithms and machine learning. But this requires a licence to operate from the public, based on trustworthiness. There are a range of concerns relating to how algorithms might be held to account in areas affecting the public sphere. This paper outlines a number of approaches including greater transparency, monitoring of outcomes and improved governance. It makes a case that public sector bodies that hold datasets should be more confident in negotiating terms with the private sector. It also argues that all regulators (not just data regulators) need to wake up to the challenges posed by changing technology. Other improvements include diversity of the workforce, ethics training, codes of conduct for data scientists, and new deliberative bodies. Even if these narrower issues are solved, the paper poses some wider concerns including data monopolies, the challenge to democracy, public participation and maintaining the public interest.

      <abstract>Software quality has been the important area of interest for decades now in the IT sector and software firms. Defect prediction gives the tester the pointers as to where the bugs will most likely be hidden in the software product. Identifying and reporting the defect probe areas is the main job of software defect prediction techniques. Early detection of software defects during Software Development Life Cycle could lead to a reduction in cost of development, time involved in further testing activities and rework effort post-production and maintenance phase, thus resulting in more reliable software. Software metrics can be used for developing the defect prediction models. Several data mining techniques can be applied on the available open-source software datasets. These datasets are extracted from software programs. Such datasets made publicly available by National Aeronautics and Space Administration for their various softwares have been extensively used in software engineering-related research activities. These datasets contain information on associated Software Metrics at module level. The proposed idea is a novel hybrid data mining technique consisting of Clustering and Modified Apriori Algorithm that results in improved efficiency and reliability of Software Defect Prediction. This technique works by reducing the number of association rules generated. The results are achieved by using interestingness measure called spread. The paper also does a comparative analysis of the results obtained from the novel technique with the existing hybrid technique of Clustering and Apriori. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract>

      <abstract>The paper provides an overview of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is applied in different government sectors. Our methodology is based on a systematic review of 74 papers retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus databases. We find that the extant literature is less focused on healthcare, ICT, education, social and cultural services, and fashion sector; while ignoring the practical implementation of AI in these sectors. We present an organizing framework stating different areas related to governance and throws light on research gaps in the extant literature that can be further worked upon for promoting the research in digital governance. © 2020</abstract>

      <abstract>The article is devoted to revealing the phenomenon of contemporary
changes in the language space, in accordance with the processes of
transition that take place in the economy of Ukraine in the context of
knowledge representation, neuro-modeling and artificial intelligence.
relevance and expediency of the study are due to the uncertainty to some
extent of innovative processes occurring in the development of the
contemporary Ukrainian language in connection with the transitional
processes in the economy. The relevance of the study is determined by:
1) the importance for contemporary linguistics of identifying and
describing the structural and typological features of the &#x60;&#x60;dominant&#39;&#39;
lexical and semantic subsystems of the contemporary Ukrainian language,
reflecting the most significant concepts of contemporary Ukrainian
conceptosphere; 2) the importance of the lexical subsystem of public
administration not only for the contemporary Ukrainian language and
contemporary Ukrainian national consciousness, but also for the
effective economic policy of the state; 3) a lack of special
generalizing research on the problems of formation, development and
current state of the Ukrainian vocabulary of state regulation of the
economy; 4) the need to clarify and improve the methodology of complex
analysis of lexical and semantic systems in the Ukrainian language,
methods and techniques of describing lexical units in synchronous and
diachronic aspects. 5) current needs in the use of artificial
intelligence, based on the principles of neuro-modeling in the
representation of knowledge in the conditions of transition economy of
Ukrain.</abstract>

      <abstract>Diff erences in the practice of Big Data (BD) usage between the private
and public sectors are causing a problem of public administration access
to advanced BD technologies and methods used in business. The high
potential of BD is in demand by public organizations while private
businesses hold these technologies and methods. The study of barriers to
the dissemination of a practice of BD usage in public administration
allows identification of possibilities and directions for BD production
and use by public organizations. Russian and foreign cases of production
and incorporation of BD in public administration for their analysis were
selected from scientifi c and business sources. The barriers limiting
work with BD in public administration are identifi ed: a legal
regulation of BD implementation, the structure and functioning of the IT
infrastructure of public administration, requirements for the quality of
data as content, and the scope and scale of socio-political development
problems in public administration. Analysis of BD application in public
administration has shown the ways of BD production, such as signal
reception and date entry, as well as the necessity of using the IT
infrastructure of business. Ways of implementing BD vary due to their
multitasking in the public and private sectors. Since BD accumulated by
public organizations is in demand by private businesses, providing a
data access mechanism can be an approach to enhancing the digital
economy at the local and state levels. The study demonstrates the high
importance of finding the ways to develop and disseminate BD for public
authorities.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article attempts to evaluate the library services and facilities
during the pandemic situations in Pakistan. This study is fashioned in
positivistic tradition of quantitative research design, and a
cross-sectional research method was employed. The objective of the study
was to examine the library services available to students and faculty
members in two public sector academic libraries in Pakistan. A complete
list of students and faculty members was collected from the concerned
offices along with their WhatsApp numbers and email address. A total of
1736 students and faculty members sampled through proportionate random
sampling technique and filled the questionnaire out of 7835. The
inclusion criteria to participate was based on enrolled students of
public and private sector university, passed at least one semester of BS
(4 years) and MA&#x2F;MSc (2 years) programme in Pakistan, and faculty
members using library resources. A structured questionnaire to measure
the response of library patrons and consisted of exogenous and
endogenous variables and pretested. The study findings showed that
COVID-19 pandemic situations affected educational institutions at a
large scale. The social distancing rule was opted to minimise the risk
of infection and university libraries were also closed down. However,
due to online learning transformation, library materials were
digitalized and online library services were provided to students and
faculty members.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: This paper attempts to explore possible contributing factors of females&#39; outperformance and males&#39; underperformance in the higher education in Pakistan from teachers&#39; perspective. The central question of the study is what are the key factors that affect female and male students&#39; educational performance at the university level? Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a framework, we attempted to predict differentials of the perceived “female outperformance” and “male underperformance” in higher education. We carried out the study by employing quantitative research methods. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: The data for the study come from 253 teachers from University of the Punjab-largest and oldest University in Pakistan. We used a structured questionnaire for data collection. The analysis was carried out with the help of ANN model. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze the data. Findings: The testing results of ANN indicated 85.3% of teachers&#39; perception was correctly predicted on various dimensions of performance differentials across female and male students in higher education. Research limitations&#x2F;implications: The study banks on primary data collected from teachers of the University of University of the Punjab, Pakistan. Thus, the study&#39;s universe was limited to one university – University of Punjab. It is purely based on a quantitative approach employing ANN. Practical implications: The findings of this study have several significant implications, i.e. it makes a significant contribution to the existing body of scholarly texts on the issue of gender reverse change in academic performance in higher education. Originality&#x2F;value: The findings of this research, derived from primary data in Pakistan context, qualify this research as an original one. We also claim that this study is one of the first studies on gender reverse change in academic performance among graduate students in a public sector university of Pakistan employing ANN. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study seeks to provide insights into Botswana’s AI readiness landscape. It was achieved by analysing secondary data from the Oxford Insights 2022-Government AI Readiness Index (AIRI). According to the AIRI, Botswana is in position 98, out of 181 countries surveyed. The major drawbacks to successful AI adoption were; a lack of AI strategy, limited capacity to support change, an immature technology sector incapable of supporting innovation, inadequate skills to support AI development, insufficient technological infrastructure to support AI, insufficient data to train AI models, and there are few use cases identified in the public sector. De-spite these hurdles, the country is putting in efforts to transform digitally and there are opportunities for improvement. The country is faring similarly, or even better than, regional peers but is lagging behind global peers in the upper middle-income group. Consequently, it is recommended that the government should start by developing an AI strategy to set the vision for AI adoption. © 2023, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

      <abstract>Banks play a vital role in strengthening the financial system of a country; hence, their survival is decisive for the stability of national economies. Therefore, analyzing the survival probability of the banks is an essential and continuing research activity. However, the current literature available indicates that research is currently limited on banks’ stress quantification in countries like India where there have been fewer failed banks. The literature also indicates a lack of scientific and quantitative approaches that can be used to predict bank survival and failure probabilities. Against this backdrop, the present study attempts to establish a bankruptcy prediction model using a machine learning approach and to compute and compare the financial stress that the banks face. The study uses the data of failed and surviving private and public sector banks in India for the period January 2000 through December 2017. The explanatory features of bank failure are chosen by using a two-step feature selection technique. First, a relief algorithm is used for primary screening of useful features, and in the second step, important features are fed into the support vector machine to create a forecasting model. The threshold values of the features for the decision boundary which separates failed banks from survival banks are calculated using the decision boundary of the support vector machine with a linear kernel. The results reveal, inter alia, that support vector machine with linear kernel shows 92.86% forecasting accuracy, while a support vector machine with radial basis function kernel shows 71.43% accuracy. The study helps to carry out comparative analyses of financial stress of the banks and has significant implications for their decisions of various stakeholders such as shareholders, management of the banks, analysts, and policymakers. © 2020 by the authors.

      <abstract>Sentiment analysis is a knowledge discovery technique developed from
data mining; its purpose is to reveal people&#39;s opinions on specific
topics. This is an appropriate technique to apply to unstructured data
sources, such as social media, that cover information on a variety of
topics (such as politics and public administration). In this context,
the objective of this study was to identify whether sentiment analysis
can reflect public opinion and, thus, contribute to practices of social
management. Therefore, the sentiment analysis technique was applied to
reveal citizens&#39; opinions, which were expressed on Twitter and concerned
some of the main social programs in force during Brazil&#39;s Rousseff
government. The study consisted of a comparison between the results of
the sentiment analysis and the concepts and applications involving four
strategies of social media used by governments from the point of view of
social management. The results revealed that the sentiment analysis
technique could contribute to social management practices in the context
of the network strategy.</abstract>

      <abstract>The increasing popularity of moped scooter-sharing as a direct and
eco-friendly transportation option highlights the need to understand
travel demand for effective urban planning and transportation
management. This study explores the use of machine learning techniques
to forecast travel demand for moped scooter-sharing services in Madrid,
Spain, based on origin-destination trip data. A comprehensive dataset
was utilized, encompassing sociodemographic characteristics, travel
attraction centers, transportation network attributes, policy-related
variables, and distance impedance. Two supervised machine learning
models, linear regression and random forest, were employed to predict
travel demand patterns. The results revealed the effectiveness of
ensemble learning methods, particularly the random forest model, in
accurately predicting travel demand and capturing complex feature
relationships. The feature scores emphasize the importance of
neighborhood characteristics such as tourist accommodations, public
administration centers, regulated parking, and commercial centers, along
with the critical role of trip distance. Users&#39; preference for
short-distance trips within the city highlights the appeal of these
services for urban mobility. The findings have implications for urban
planning and transportation decision-making to better accommodate travel
patterns, improve the overall transportation system, and inform policy
recommendations to enhance intermodal connectivity and sustainable urban
mobility.</abstract>

      <abstract>Fraud analytics refers to the use of advanced analytics (data mining,
big data analysis, or artificial intelligence) to detect fraud. While
fraud analytics offers the promise of more efficiency in fighting fraud,
it also raises legal challenges related to data protection and
administrative law. These legal requirements are well documented but the
concrete way in which public administrations have integrated them
remains unexplored. Due to the complexity of the techniques applied, it
is crucial to understand the current state of practice and the
accompanying challenges to develop appropriate governance mechanisms.
The use of advanced analytics in organizations without appropriate
organizational change can lead to ethical challenges and privacy issues.
The goal of this article is to examine how these legal requirements are
addressed in public administrations and to identify the challenges that
emerge in doing so. For this, we examined two case studies related to
fraud analytics from the Belgian Federal administration: the detection
of tax frauds and social security infringements. This article details 15
governance practices that have been used in administrations.
Furthermore, it highlights the complexity of integrating legal
requirements with advanced analytics by identifying six key trade-offs
between fraud analytics opportunities and legal requirements.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article compares two studies, investigating administrator, faculty, and student perceptions of quality in online&#x2F;blended courses conducted in two different contexts, namely (1) two midsize public universities in the United States, and (2) a college in a public university in Malaysia. The research question explored in both studies was: What is the meaning of “quality” in an online&#x2F;blended course to administrators, faculty, and students? Survey data from the three constituents in both contexts were obtained. Qualitative data analysis revealed the top 7-8 quality features of each context as ranked by number of references. The results revealed similarities and differences in the rankings of the quality features between constituents and between contexts. Similarities suggested that different constituents had different priorities with regards to quality features while differences appeared to be based on where each institution was on their distance education trajectory. These findings should be considered and reflected on in online course design, teaching strategies, and student support. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.</abstract>

      <abstract>As governments around the world become increasingly datafied, debates are emerging about the best ways to attend to the complex socio-political implications of big data and the datafication of the state. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with senior executives and data experts within Australian government agencies, high-level privacy experts, and other experts in public sector data integration, this article examines how a sociotechnical imaginary about data-driven, democratic government acts within and alongside routinely bureaucratised forms of techno-legal risk management to inform the work of Australia&#39;s data integration experts. Notably, these techno-legal experts recognised the limitations of techno-legal data management, and mobilised notions of the social license when seeking to (re)orient the trajectories of data integration towards the democratic, data-driven government they envisage. Contributing to debates about the datafication of the state, we argue that while a social license will not be a panacea to all the complexities of datafication, a social license with institutional roots is essential to deepen accountability towards publics, and to help ensure that datafication can be co-produced by, and reflective of, the sociotechnical futures envisaged by a broader range of publics. © 2023 The Authors</abstract>

      <abstract>The expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) in public
administration is generating numerous opportunities for governments.
Current Spanish regulations have established electronic administration
and support the expansion and implementation of this new technology, but
they may not be adapted to the legal needs caused by AI. Consequently,
this research aims to identify the risks associated with AI uses in
Spanish public administration and if the legal mechanisms can solve
them. We answer these questions by employing a qualitative research
approach, conducting semi-structured interviews with several experts in
the matter. Despite the benefits that this technology may involve,
throughout this research we can confirm that the use of artificial
intelligence can generate several problems such as opacity, legal
uncertainty, biases, or breaches of personal data protection. The
mechanisms already provided by Spanish law are not enough to avoid these
risks as they have not been designed to face the use of artificial
intelligence in public administration. In addition, a homogeneous legal
definition of AI needs to be established.</abstract>

      <abstract>Although designed and implemented with the best of intentions, along
with the advantages for good governance, the potential risks of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) have already been identified in multiple
areas, stemming from the existence of programming errors, opacity, data
protection breaches, biases or manipulation, for example.
There are many AI codes of ethics, coming from different segments of the
global society and from various disciplines, that seek to avoid and&#x2F;or
remedy these AI risks. Some academics and practitioners argue that a
voluntary ethical approach is appropriate for this fast-paced and
beneficial technology, and that legal regulation should be avoided
because it could stifle innovation and reduce the many benefits of AI.
In countries such as the United States of America, voluntary
self-regulation, sometimes led by ethical codes, is often preferred in
emerging technology fields.
On the other hand, the European Union has published a &#x60;&#x60;Proposal for a
Regulation on Artificial Intelligence&#39;&#39; that was stimulated in part by
a European Parliament resolution on ethical AI that called for legal
regulation of AI. Both approaches highlight in practice the tension
between those in favor of AI control only through ethics and those who
believe that legal intervention is necessary.
This article deals with an issue that is still little addressed, the
relationship between ethics and law in relation to AI. The paper deals
with the concept of ethical AI and its guarantee through ethical codes,
the relationship between ethics and law in this field, the content of
the latter with respect to AI, with particular attention to the use of
AI by the public sector, and the different approaches to this issue,
which undoubtedly requires a transdisciplinary approach.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper studies whether investments in Industry 4.0 improve performance and give SMEs (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) an opportunity to get ahead. We base our research on the competitive context by considering the number of firms in specific industries and the inverted-U framework. We analyze the effects of investing in five digital enablers (Big Data, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Advanced Robotics, and the Internet of Things) on firm revenues, labor performance, and profitability in terms of neck-and-neck and leader-laggard competition models. Results from 274 SMEs for the period 2005–2018 show that these effects depend on the technology implemented. Big Data contributes to competitive advantages, while investing in Advanced Robots is negative for sales growth. We do not have conclusive results about Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, and the Internet of Things. These findings have relevant implications for both managers and public administrations, as they demonstrate that investing in Industry 4.0 improves productivity in the case of some of the enablers. © 2022</abstract>

      <abstract>Most engineers predict future building energy consumption via simulation programs in the pre-design phase. In this process, many simulation steps have to be repeated to predict building energy consumption. The authors in this article proposed another way to select optimal building materials for saving commercial building energy in the U.S. using soft computing methods. To achieve the research goal, reliable public data that is provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration was used. The data contain numerous energy-related characteristics of buildings including gas, electricity, types of materials, and climate conditions of 6,700 commercial buildings located in the U.S. This study utilized two methods to find out optimal building materials for saving energy. First, the Principle Component Analysis was used to determine which building characteristics among over 400 characteristics have the greatest impact on gas and electricity consumption. Second, Association Rule Mining was used to extract combinations of optimal building materials. Since a building consists of a combination of various materials, energy simulation should predict for multiple factors rather than a single factor. The use of these methods would greatly reduce resources, such as limited budget and time, during the simulation process. © 2022, College Publishing. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>The digital heritage sector is among the nine common European data spaces outlined in the EU Data Act: Health, Industrial, Agriculture, Finance, Mobility, Green Deal, Energy, Public Administration, and Skills. The data space concept is complex, and being linked with the data ecosystem brings together methodologies and techniques from numerous domains: artificial intelligence (AI), text&#x2F;data mining, data visualisation, mapping, image analysis, audio analysis, network analysis, and rights management. There is a need for clarifying data terminology in use for the GLAM field and transferable methodology to strengthen its’ ongoing datafication and digital skill set. The paper offers a comprehensive literature review (incl. EU Data (space) policy documents) on data spaces and data ecosystems aimed at (1) formulating the main challenges in data collection, data processing, and data maturity for heritage-related information systems and (2) justification of the necessary mindset and digital skill set change for a mature museum. General conclusions are made as well as recommendations for the Bulgarian GLAM sector. © 2024, Union of Bulgarian Mathematicians. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>We are recently witnessing a radical shift towards digitisation in many
aspects of our daily life, including law, public administration and
governance. This has sometimes been done with the aim of reducing costs
and human errors by improving data analysis and management, but not
without raising major technological challenges. One of these challenges
is certainly the need to cope with relatively small amounts of data,
without sacrificing performance. Indeed, cutting-edge approaches to
(natural) language processing and understanding are often data-hungry,
especially those based on deep learning. With this paper we seek to
address the problem of data scarcity in automatic Legalese (or legal
English) processing and understanding. What we propose is an ensemble of
shallow and deep learning techniques called SyntagmTuner, designed to
combine the accuracy of deep learning with the ability of shallow
learning to work with little data. Our contribution is based on the
assumption that Legalese differs from its spoken language in the way the
meaning is encoded by the structure of the text and the co-occurrence of
words. As result, we show with SyntagmTuner how we can perform important
tasks for e-governance, as multi-label classification of the United
Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolutions or legal question answering,
with data-sets of roughly 100 samples or even less.</abstract>

      <abstract>Introduction: This study focuses on eliciting the leadership styles used in the decisionmaking process against various organizational levels across different organizational types and the influence of the position, age, experience, department, education under differing situations among the employed people of UAE. Initially, the authors believed that participant&#39;s traits such as age, education would have the major impact rather than position-based experience, industry, and different situations on the leadership styles expressed. However, a deeper analysis and study of the data gathered from various organizations, the results were surprisingly different. Aim: The analysis of the study revealed how the participant&#39;s position, qualifications, experienced and industry affected the leadership styles. Some very interesting questions and situations have been attempted to understand the leadership style in this report based on a standard leadership style survey. This paper aims to report the findings of an empirical study exploring the relationship between three prominent models of leadership styles using the independent variables. Further, a Neural Network analysis methods and identify the most prominent influencer of the choice probability of leadership style. The independent variable which relates to the demographic and work-related includes factor such as age, gender, level of education, industry type, levels of management, total work experience, experience in the organization. Methodology: The study is an empirical study based on leadership questionnaire survey using multivariate analysis followed by neural network estimation on the data collected from employees across various levels of management in the UAE. Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire developed and administered as a means of objective assessment of the leadership style of various managers across the UAE followed by the categorizing of scores to identify prominent&#x2F;explicit styles and dormant styles that were then analyzed based on modeling. Findings: The results reveal that the spectrum of three leadership styles containing basic characteristics, such as the type of branches, the age, and educational level are inter-related with communication, commitment, satisfaction, and effectiveness. The authors conclude that the unique setting and context found in the public sector-very much defined by the UAE Constitution-leads to subtle, but very real and noteworthy differences. The current literature around the world show that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector based on the various analyses. However, our research analyses gives a different picture for the UAE. The results shows that in the UAE the public sector is more effective and efficient than the private sector because of the leadership styles followed in this sector. Research Limitations&#x2F;Implications: Limitations include the self-report methodology that measures perceptual data with a series of questionnaire items. The survey responses that were complete for analysis were more skewed towards the public sector as the other sectors did not respond well. Originality&#x2F;Value: The paper is original research that identifies the characteristics of an organization linked to selected demographic (personal and professional) variables of all level of managers on their managerial style in the UAE. © 2002-2019 Allied Business Academies.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public procurement is a large market affecting almost every organisation
and individual; therefore, governments need to ensure its efficiency,
transparency, and accountability, while creating healthy, competitive,
and vibrant economies. In this context, open data initiatives and
integration of data from multiple sources across national borders could
transform the procurement market by such as lowering the barriers of
entry for smaller suppliers and encouraging healthier competition, in
particular by enabling cross-border bids. Increasingly more open data is
published in the public sector; however, these are created and
maintained in siloes and are not straightforward to reuse or maintain
because of technical heterogeneity, lack of quality, insufficient
metadata, or missing links to related domains. To this end, we developed
an open linked data platform, called TheyBuyForYou, consisting of a set
of modular APIs and ontologies to publish, curate, integrate, analyse,
and visualise an EU-wide, cross-border, and cross-lingual procurement
knowledge graph. We developed advanced tools and services on top of the
knowledge graph for anomaly detection, cross-lingual document search,
and data storytelling. This article describes the TheyBuyForYou platform
and knowledge graph, reports their adoption by different stakeholders
and challenges and experiences we went through while creating them, and
demonstrates the usefulness of Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies
for enhancing public procurement.</abstract>

      <abstract>Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being increasingly applied, considerable distrust about introducing “disruptive” technologies persists. Intrinsic and contextual factors influencing where and how such innovations are introduced therefore require careful scrutiny to ensure that health equity is promoted. To illustrate one such critical approach, we describe and appraise an AI application - the development of computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) to support more efficient adjudication of compensation claims from former gold miners with occupational lung disease in Southern Africa. In doing so, we apply a bio-ethical lens that considers the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice and add explicability as a core principle. We draw on the AI literature, our research on CAD validation and process efficiency, as well as apprehensions of users and stakeholders. Issues of concern included AI accuracy, biased training of AI systems, data privacy, impact on human skill development, transparency and accountability in AI use, as well as intellectual property ownership. We discuss ways in which each of these potential obstacles to successful use of CAD could be mitigated. We conclude that efforts to overcoming technical challenges in applying AI must be accompanied from the onset by attention to ensuring its ethical use. © 2021 The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>We characterized the spatial distribution of drug-susceptible (DS) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) cases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, a major metropolis in southeastern Asia, and explored demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with local TB burden. Hot spots of DS and MDR TB incidence were observed in the central parts of Ho Chi Minh City, and substantial heterogeneity was observed across wards. Positive spatial autocorrelation was observed for both DS TB and MDR TB. Ward-level TB incidence was associated with HIV prevalence and the male proportion of the population. No ward-level demographic and socioeconomic indicators were associated with MDR TB case count relative to total TB case count. Our findings might inform spatially targeted TB control strategies and provide insights for generating hypotheses about the nature of the relationship between DS and MDR TB in Ho Chi Minh City and the wider southeastern region of Asia. © 2024 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

      <abstract>The world is currently driven by data. With fast improving technology,
the construction industry is inevitable to accept that their industry is
being driven by the data. However, implementation of new technology into
construction industry is difficult unlike in other industries. Thailand
is attempting to improve the country with big data technology, which
impacts the construction industry. The readiness of applying big data
technology for Construction Management is therefore important. This
research employed the qualitative approach to identify the readiness
factor of applying big data technology for construction management of
the Thai government. Semi-structured questionnaires and interviews were
used as a research instrument. More than seven government officers are
Key Informants (KIs), selected by a convenience sampling method. The KIs
have been working in a field of information technology at seven
different government departments. Typology and transcribed analysis was
used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that the Thai government
has been preparing infrastructure to support big data technology.
However, the readiness factors of concern are Technological and
Organizational factors, as the government has launched a new policy for
the country. Government agencies have to start applying big data
technology to support their work to conform to the new policy.</abstract>

      <abstract>The emergence of the Internet as a central phenomenon of the post-industrial era has generated structural changes in all socio-economic processes, including public administration. On this note, e-government has become the new practice, aimed to reshape the relationship between state and citizen, but showing considerable differences in the way it is adopted worldwide. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for assessing whether socio-demographic characteristics such as the urban population, the average years spent in school, or the overall median age of the population can successfully explain the level of e-government adaptation (measured through the EGDI). To observe it, we will use data from six years, from 2010 to 2020, and 130 countries of the UN. As tools, we have employed a multi-model approach that consists of regression and neural network models, with two main directions of analysis: individual yearly methods and longitudinal panel data. © 2023, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

      <abstract>Data-intensive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, imply huge
opportunities for transforming the delivery of healthcare and social
services, improving people&#39;s quality of life and working in the health
and welfare system. The aim of this paper is to present examples of the
implementation of artificial intelligence techniques in healthcare and
social services and to sketch the trends and challenges in the adoption
of artificial intelligence techniques, with an emphasis on the public
sector and selected public services. Analysis is based on a realistic
assessment of current artificial intelligence technologies and their
anticipated development. Besides the benefits and potential
opportunities for healthcare and social services, there are also
challenges for governments. Understanding the huge potential of
artificial intelligence as well as its limitations will be a key step
forward, but it is essential to avoid the trap of an overestimation of
artificial intelligence potential.(1)</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to review literature about the applications
of artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic situations and identify the
research that is needed in the area of applying AI to strategic
marketing decisions.
Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach
The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with
marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper.
Findings
There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing
decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI
application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from
operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions
and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is
time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions.
Research limitations&#x2F;implications
The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to
be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not
available to the authors.
Practical implications
There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large
businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the
face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their
decision-making could be dangerous.
Social implications
The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although
in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions
about making different services available to different citizens and
identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so,
this paper is relevant to the public sector.
Originality&#x2F;value
To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, this is one of the first papers
to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in
generative language modelling, hold the promise of transforming
government. Given the advanced capabilities of new AI systems, it is
critical that these are embedded using standard operational procedures,
clear epistemic criteria, and behave in alignment with the normative
expectations of society. Scholars in multiple domains have subsequently
begun to conceptualize the different forms that AI applications may
take, highlighting both their potential benefits and pitfalls. However,
the literature remains fragmented, with researchers in social science
disciplines like public administration and political science, and the
fast-moving fields of AI, ML, and robotics, all developing concepts in
relative isolation. Although there are calls to formalize the emerging
study of AI in government, a balanced account that captures the full
depth of theoretical perspectives needed to understand the consequences
of embedding AI into a public sector context is lacking. Here, we unify
efforts across social and technical disciplines by first conducting an
integrative literature review to identify and cluster 69 key terms that
frequently co-occur in the multidisciplinary study of AI. We then build
on the results of this bibliometric analysis to propose three new
multifaceted concepts for understanding and analysing AI-based systems
for government (AI-GOV) in a more unified way: (1) operational fitness,
(2) epistemic alignment, and (3) normative divergence. Finally, we put
these concepts to work by using them as dimensions in a conceptual
typology of AI-GOV and connecting each with emerging AI technical
measurement standards to encourage operationalization, foster
cross-disciplinary dialogue, and stimulate debate among those aiming to
rethink government with AI.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: There is good evidence of both community support for sharing public sector administrative health data in the public interest and concern about data security, misuse and loss of control over health information, particularly if private sector organizations are the data recipients. To date, there is little research describing the perspectives of informed community members on private sector use of public health data and, particularly, on the conditions under which that use might be justified. Methods: Two citizens&#39; juries were held in February 2020 in two locations close to Sydney, Australia. Jurors considered the charge: ‘Under what circumstances is it permissible for governments to share health data with private industry for research and development?’. Results: All jurors, bar one, in principle supported sharing government administrative health data with private industry for research and development. The support was conditional and the juries&#39; recommendations specifying these conditions related closely to the concerns they identified in deliberation. Conclusion: The outcomes of the deliberative processes suggest that informed Australian citizens are willing to accept sharing their administrative health data, including with private industry, providing the intended purpose is clearly of public benefit, sharing occurs responsibly in a framework of accountability, and the data are securely held. Patient and Public Contribution: The design of the jury was guided by an Advisory Group including representatives from a health consumer organization. The jurors themselves were selected to be descriptively representative of their communities and with independent facilitation wrote the recommendations. © 2021 The Authors.

      <abstract>Background: Technology promises the provision of public services to be
more efficient, transparent, cheaper, and faster, but current issues
associated with various technologies, such as, inter alia,
discrimination, the &#x60;black-box&#39; problem, or cybersecurity issues raise
concerns about potential legal risks. Accordingly, the question of
whether democracies survive potential threats to legal norms arises.
Various EU institutions express the position that we must promote
technological applications but, at the same time, ensure adequate
protection of human rights. However, sometimes this line is very thin -
thus, it is necessary to examine how, and which technological
applications should be applied in the public sector in order not to
violate</abstract>

      <abstract>The nascent adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the public
sector is being assessed in contradictory ways. But while there is
increasing speculation about both its dangers and its benefits, there is
very little empirical research to substantiate them. This study aims at
mapping the challenges in the adoption of AI in the public sector as
perceived by key stakeholders. Drawing on the theoretical lens of
framing, we analyse a case of adoption of the AI system IBM Watson in
public healthcare in China, to map how three groups of stakeholders
(government policy-makers, hospital managers&#x2F;doctors, and Information
Technology (IT) firm managers) perceive the challenges of AI adoption in
the public sector. Findings show that different stakeholders have
diverse, and sometimes contradictory, framings of the challenges. We
contribute to research by providing an empirical basis to claims of AI
challenges in the public sector, and to practice by providing four sets
of guidelines for the governance of AI adoption in the public sector.</abstract>

      <abstract>Objective: This study aimed to find out the opportunity of artificial intelligence (AI) and the risk in health service. Method: A comprehensive literature search was collected from three databases (Web of Science, Google Scholar, and EBSCOhost) to identify articles studied Implementing AI in improving in health services. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results: The application will improve diagnostics, prevention, and treatment of patients, increasing cost efficiency and equality and equality in health services. For the challenge, there is no AI adoption in public sector, patients’ privacy, patient autonomy rights become problems in AI applications. Conclusions: Implementation of AI is needed in the efficiency of health service management as well as making medical decisions. The challenge is facilitating early adoption and ongoing implementation in the health care system, and we consider some of the ethical problem lists faced by AI clinical application. © 2020 SESPAS</abstract>

      <abstract>Machine learning (ML) offers widely-recognized, but complex,
opportunities for both public and private sector organizations to
generate value from data. A key requirement is that organizations must
find ways to develop new knowledge by merging crucial &#x60;domain knowledge
&#x60; of experts in relevant fields with &#x60;machine knowledge &#x60;, i.e., data
that can be used to inform predictive models. In this paper, we argue
that understanding the process of generating such knowledge is essential
to strategically develop ML. In efforts to contribute to such
understanding, we examine the generation of new knowledge from domain
knowledge through ML via an exploratory study of two cases in the
Swedish public sector. The findings reveal the roles of three mechanisms
- dubbed consolidation, algorithmic mediation, and naturalization - in
tying domain knowledge to machine knowledge. The study contributes a
theory of knowledge production related to organizational use of ML, with
important implications for its strategic governance, particularly in the
public sector.</abstract>

      <abstract>Since requirements of service demands are becoming increasingly complex and diversified, one of the success factors of a multimodal service system is its capability to design a specific service instance satisfying a specific set of requirements. This capability is further highlighted in Ad Hoc Multimodal Service Systems (AHMSSs), where service instances rarely follow a standard form of service delivery and exist only for a limited time. However, due to the increasing scale and frequency of services in many business and public sectors, meeting the desired level of capability has become troublesome. A well-designed Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach can be a solution to the difficulty by addressing the underlying complexity and uncertainty of the AHMSS design process. To conceptualize and foster AI applications to an AHMSS, this study identifies key decision-making problems in the AHMSS design process and discusses the role of AI in the process. The results will form the basis for AI development and implementation for an AHMSS and relevant service systems. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big Data literature has a strong emphasis on opportunities and value realization from Big Data use, yet evidence suggests that most Big Data projects fail to deliver on their expectations. It is necessary for organizations to recognize risks and manage them before they affect the business. The aim of the study is to uncover the risks of Big Data use from an empirical perspective. Accordingly, this paper reports on a multiple case study approach, involving eight organizations from the private and public sectors. The study results provide current risks associated with Big Data use in the organization context. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>The last decade has seen the rapid development of digital information technology, the intellectualization of control systems, the increase in the number and capacity of mobile and computer devices, and the accumulation of large amounts of data and its processing through machine learning algorithms, which inevitably leads to new opportunities for economic development. Rapid digitalization and its penetration into various spheres of public life contributed to increasing the level of transparency of public administration, strengthening public control, and reducing the bureaucratization of society. Hence, digital technologies can serve as tools to fight corruption and create conditions for intensive economic growth. Therefore, the topic based on the study of transmission effects in the chain &quot;corruption-digitization-economic growth&quot; is relevant. The work aims to develop methodological tools for assessing the transmission effects between digitalization, corruption level decrease, and economic growth. The following methods were used for the study: Levin-Lin-Chu, Hadri, Pesaran, and Chin tests, Dickey-Fuller tests - to check stationary variables; statistical criterion Kao - to check the existence of cointegration relationship between variables; modified least-squares method - to estimate regression coefficients based on panel data; coefficient of determination and Jarque-Bera test - to verify the adequacy of the econometric model. An empirical study confirmed the hypothesis of the presence of transmission effects between indicators that characterize the level of corruption in the economy, digitalization, and economic growth. It has been proven that the reduction of corruption and the growth of digitalization in studied countries contributes to economic growth. © 2022, Fintech Aliance LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>This research was conducted to determine knowledge acquisition by employing digital technology for public sector employees. This study adopts system quality, information quality, user satisfaction, service quality, and net benefit as the empirical considerations. The data analysis technique in this study used SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). Respondents in this study were 198 people con-sisting of public sector employees who used a learning management system. The results showed that service quality has a significant effect on user satisfaction. User satisfaction has a significant effect on net benefits. Meanwhile, system quality had no significant effect on user satisfaction, information quality had a significant effect on user satisfaction. The findings would imply the strategies to strengthen the implementation of e-learning is to increase user satisfaction. The finding manageri-ally points out the necessity to evaluate the transformation of classical training programs in terms of face-to-face learning to blended learning by integrating online learning and face-to-face in the public sector knowledge acquisition model of training. The findings present an evaluation using empirical examination and highlights the importance of continuity to arrange action plans in public sector to synchronize knowledge acquisition model through training to obtain behavioral change and wider organizational impact of the training on public sector institutions. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.</abstract>

      <abstract>Competence development as the main approach to improve organizational performance and competitiveness is applied not only in the private sector, but also in the public sector. In numerous countries, this measure has been integrated with wider measures of bureaucratic reform. In Indonesia, however, the reform of competence development is also associated with the increasing awareness that the old model of competence development has insignificant effect on the achievement of organizational goals. Employing literature study, this paper attempts to describe and analyze the ongoing and prospective measures to reform the competence development of apparatus from two dimensions, namely the implementation system and the implementing actors. Observed from the implementation system, competence development has undertaken a great improvement with a great emphasis on workplace learning and online learning. Meanwhile, observed from the implementing actors, the improvement is carried out by reorienting the role of widyaiswara (trainers) and introducing a new functional position of competence development analyst. These measures are expected to allow more relevant implementation of competence development to achieve organizational goals as well as increase participant motivation and current challenges, even though the evaluation of the extent to which these reform measures are effective and successful will require time. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.</abstract>

      <abstract>BACKGROUND: Indonesian Government advised to begin to open the school for offline learning with strict COVID-19 prevention protocol in early September 2021. However, this policy may cause parents to feel anxious and concerned about their children’s health during face-to-face learning. The previous research has focused on parents’ perspectives and readiness toward their children’s digital use in general, leaving their beliefs, attitudes, and readiness concerning offline learning in the COVID-19 pandemic unexplored. AIM: This study aimed to identify knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward children’s offline learning among parents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was used to collect data using Survey Monkey. The sample in this study was parents who had children aged 6–12-years-old and willing to participate in this study. A linear regression model was employed to find readiness-related factors. RESULTS: A total of 800 (response rate was 80%) participants participated in the study. The average age was 34 (SD &#x3D; 12.3), 60% were female and 54% worked in the public sector. Participants had an average knowledge score of 10.3 (SD &#x3D; 3.27, with a range of 0–13), parental attitudes concerning the advantages and disadvantages of offline schooling versus online learning were 3.88 (SD &#x3D; 0.12), the belief was 3.78 (SD &#x3D; 0.89), and the readiness score was 3.45 (SD &#x3D; 0.89). Attitude (β &#x3D; 3.04 and p &#x3D; 0.001) and belief (β &#x3D; 2.89 and p &#x3D; 0.001) were the factors associated with readiness to offline learning outbreak COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the implementation of offline learning during the pandemic has been a positive response by families. Individuals may also benefit from targeted health education programs to strengthen COVID-19 knowledge, belief, and preparation for offline learning during pandemic COVID-19. © 2022 Titin Sutini, Anita Apriliawati, Medya Aprilia Astuti, Intan Trias Wulandari, Refina Tri Santi.</abstract>

      <abstract>Purpose: This paper examines the implementation of the Public Sector Information (PSI) directive in two Swedish municipalities amidst a changing information management landscape impacted by e-government development. Government information is currently looked upon as a “gold mine” and “raw material” to be explored by interested parties. The PSI directive grants European citizens a right to access government information flows (PSI) in order to develop new electronic services. The Swedish government implemented its PSI directive in July 2010. Swedish municipalities have to embrace the directive and make the PSI available to the general public. The literature review highlighted a number of critical issues that should be addressed if PSI initiatives are to succeed. This study revealed that the two municipalities had different resource capacities, and the levels of e-government development varied. This meant that the implementation of the PSI directive also varied. The bigger municipality with a bigger budget had implemented the PSI directive and was publishing data sets on its website, while the smaller municipality with a smaller budget only published a few documents. This paper, therefore, argues that the municipalities should have the same capacity if the PSI is to be a democratic endeavor to serve all citizens. Good quality PSI will also require the municipalities to embrace a records and information continua thinking, which highlights the necessity to proactively and holistically manage the information for pluralization in different contexts. Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach: This paper builds on interviews that were conducted with four municipal officers. The number of respondents is quite small because the focus was specifically on people who were responsible for the implementation of the PSI directive in the municipalities. The respondents were identified through their fellow colleagues and they also recommended each other. Pickard refers to this kind of approach as a snow-bowling approach. Through interviews and observation, one participant advises on issues that need further inquiry and, hence, directs the researcher to another person who might offer more answers. A general interview guide approach was used to solicit answers to issues such as the implementation of the PSI directive, guidelines for PSI publication, if terms such as big data and open data were being used in the municipalities, if the municipalities had an information governance plan and how it was understood, if the information systems were well aligned to meet with the requirements of the PSI directive, how e-government development affected information management and information security and if the municipalities had information security guidelines. Findings: The Swedish government requires its administrations to engage in e-government development. This development has led to increased amounts of information that the municipalities have to effectively manage and make available to the general public. However, the municipalities operate under different conditions. Municipalities that are financially stronger are better placed to invest in measures that will lead to better quality PSI. All municipalities are, however, expected to implement the PSI directive. The two municipalities that were the subjects of this study had different information management environments and the capacity to invest in information management systems that would facilitate the management of their information resources. The budgetary constraints faced by smaller municipalities might impact the implementation of the PSI directive and, hence, hinder the publication of the PSI. e-Government is meant to be an inclusive project, and the PSI is meant for all citizens with innovative ideas. There is a risk that citizens who belong to poorer municipalities might not be equally privileged compared to those living in resourceful municipalities. This poses a democratic challenge that should concern all people interested in an open and inclusive society. Originality&#x2F;value: Little research has so far been published on the implementation process of the PSI directive. The discourses that have started to emerge discuss the challenges of open data without paying much attention to the creation, capture and the management aspects of the PSI. The originality of this paper, therefore, lies in the application of the records and information continua thinking, which highlights dimensions that enhance information management and the democratic challenges that will be caused by the data divide, as municipalities have different capabilities when it comes to the publication of the PSI. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>

      <abstract>PurposeThis study aims to examine the necessity effects of big data
analytics capabilities (BDAC) on decision-making performance (DMP),
particularly in the public sector.Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approachThe authors
used the combined methods of partial least square structural equation
modeling (PLS-SEM) and necessary condition analysis (NCA) to test the
hypothesized relationships.FindingsThe findings show that the presence
of all three BDAC (infrastructure, management and personnel) is
significant and necessary to achieve higher levels of DMP. Specifically,
the results revealed big data management capabilities to be of higher
necessity to achieve the highest possible DMP. The findings provide
public-sector practitioners with insights to support the development of
their BDAC.Originality&#x2F;valueTime-sensitive domains such as the public
sector require insight and quality decision-making to create public
value and achieve competitive advantage. This study examined BDAC in
light of the combined methods of (PLS-SEM) and NCA to test the
hypothesized relationships in the public sector context.</abstract>

      <abstract>Cross-experiment comparisons in public data compendia are challenged by unmatched conditions and technical noise. The ADAGE method, which performs unsupervised integration with denoising autoencoder neural networks, can identify biological patterns, but because ADAGE models, like many neural networks, are over-parameterized, different ADAGE models perform equally well. To enhance model robustness and better build signatures consistent with biological pathways, we developed an ensemble ADAGE (eADAGE) that integrated stable signatures across models. We applied eADAGE to a compendium of Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene expression profiling experiments performed in 78 media. eADAGE revealed a phosphate starvation response controlled by PhoB in media with moderate phosphate and predicted that a second stimulus provided by the sensor kinase, KinB, is required for this PhoB activation. We validated this relationship using both targeted and unbiased genetic approaches. eADAGE, which captures stable biological patterns, enables cross-experiment comparisons that can highlight measured but undiscovered relationships. © 2017 The Author(s)</abstract>

      <abstract>Algorithmic systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly
play a role in decision-making processes, both in government and
industry. These systems are used in areas such as retail, finances, and
manufacturing. In the latter domain, the main priority is that the
solutions are interpretable, as this characteristic correlates to the
adoption rate of users (e.g., schedulers). However, more recently, these
systems have been applied in areas of public interest, such as
education, health, public administration, and criminal justice. The
adoption of these systems in this domain, in particular the data-driven
decision models, has raised questions about the risks associated with
this technology, from which ethical problems may emerge. We analyse two
important characteristics, interpretability and trustability, of
AI-based systems in the industrial and public domains, respectively.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this article, we address the theme &#x60;Future of Work&#39; with focus on the
Brazilian Federal District&#39;s public sector. Brazil is a federative
republic and the federated entity in question has the eighth largest GDP
among the 27 Brazilian federated entities (26 states and the Federal
District). Since it is the seat of the federal executive branch, the
Federal District has the highest GDP per capita, almost twice that of
the runner-up, thus justifying the importance of analyzing its
governmental structure. To do so, we reproduced the method of Kubota and
Maciente (2019) to estimate the tendency to automate occupations,
employing the occupation database of the Federal District&#39;s executive
civil servants. The results showed that jobs that require lower levels
of education and involve more routine tasks are more prone to
automation. Finally, based on our results, we performed a descriptive
statistical analysis of schooling, age, and remuneration of public
positions in the Federal District.</abstract>

      <abstract>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a growing public and veterinary health concern, and the ability to accurately predict AMR from antibiotics administration data is crucial for effectively treating and managing infections. While genomics-based approaches can provide better results, sequencing, assembling, and applying Machine Learning (ML) methods can take several hours. Therefore, alternative approaches are required. This study focused on using ML for antimicrobial stewardship by utilising data extracted from hospital electronic health records, which can be done in real-time, and developing an interpretable 1D-Transformer model for predicting AMR. A multi-baseline Integrated Gradient pipeline was also incorporated to interpret the model, and quantitative validation metrics were introduced to validate the model. The performance of the proposed 1D-Transformer model was evaluated using a dataset of urinary tract infection (UTI) patients with four antibiotics. The proposed 1D-Transformer model achieved 10% higher area under curve (AUC) in predicting AMR and outperformed traditional ML models. The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) pipeline also provided interpretable results, identifying the signatures contributing to the predictions. This could be used as a decision support tool for personalised treatment, introducing AMR-aware food and management of AMR, and it could also be used to identify signatures for targeted interventions.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 3.8 has emphasized the persistence of health risks as a major challenge for emerging and developing countries. This challenge necessitates the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by enhancing the infrastructure of the public sector. However, relying solely on public sector healthcare may not be sufficient to meet the needs of large populations, particularly in underdeveloped regions. Consequently, private sector healthcare solutions have emerged to fill service gaps, but they remain unaffordable for many low -income individuals. To the end, Health insurance can play a crucial role in making these services more accessible and affordable, but it faces several challenges including poor accessibility, low awareness, lack of skilled workforce, and corruption. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies can offer solutions to these challenges. However, the adoption of technology in the insurance domain poses behavioral challenges that must be identified and addressed. This is particularly important in developing and emerging countries where markets are still underdeveloped, and information asymmetries are high. This study examines some of these challenges by studying people’s attitude towards humanoid agents. For this study a case study approach has ben used. Overall, addressing the challenges of health insurance and incorporating advanced technologies can provide a vital safety net against health risks to people. © The Author(s) 2023.</abstract>

      <abstract>There is currently an ongoing, global race to develop, implement, and make use of AI in both the private and public sectors. How AI will affect responsibilities and public values to be upheld by government remains to be seen. This paper analyzes how AI is portrayed in Swedish policy documents and what values are attributed to the use of AI, based on an established e-government value framework. Statements are identified in policy documents and are coded into one of four value ideals, as well as being either a benefit, a consideration, or a risk. We conclude that there is discrepancy in the policy level discourse concerning AI between the different value ideals and that the discourse surrounding AI is overly optimistic. A more nuanced view of AI in government is needed to create realistic expectations. © 2020, Department for E-Governance and Administration. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>The significance of a bank’s financial stability for achieving a thriving and robust economy cannot be overstated. This study develops a predictive model using machine learning (ML) to categorise banks into low- or high-performance. The non-performing assets (NPA) levels of the Indian banking sector, notably for the public sector banks (PSBs), have increased significantly since 2015. Hence, the model has been created using bank performance data of PSBs, specifically for the period 2015–2020. The authors first identified logical groups by using the unsupervised K-means clustering method; and, subsequently, deployed a supervised algorithm for prediction: the classification and regression tree (CART). The model has an overall prediction accuracy of 0.9375, a sensitivity of 0.8571 and a specificity of 0.9600. This study is unique since it uses only data from banks with high NPA levels to create a predictive model for bank performance. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study proposed a holistic three-fold scheme that synergistically optimizes the benefits of the Water-Food-Energy (WFE) Nexus by integrating the short&#x2F;long-term joint operation of a multi-objective reservoir with irrigation ponds in response to urbanization. The three-fold scheme was implemented step by step: (1) optimizing short-term (daily scale) reservoir operation for maximizing hydropower output and final reservoir storage during typhoon seasons; (2) simulating long-term (ten-day scale) water shortage rates in consideration of the availability of irrigation ponds for both agricultural and public sectors during non-typhoon seasons; and (3) promoting the synergistic benefits of the WFE Nexus in a year-round perspective by integrating the short-term optimization and long-term simulation of reservoir operations. The pivotal Shihmen Reservoir and 745 irrigation ponds located in Taoyuan City of Taiwan together with the surrounding urban areas formed the study case. The results indicated that the optimal short-term reservoir operation obtained from the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) could largely increase hydropower output but just slightly affected water supply. The simulation results of the reservoir coupled with irrigation ponds indicated that such joint operation could significantly reduce agricultural and public water shortage rates by 22.2% and 23.7% in average, respectively, as compared to those of reservoir operation excluding irrigation ponds. The results of year-round short&#x2F;long-term joint operation showed that water shortage rates could be reduced by 10% at most, the food production rate could be increased by up to 47%, and the hydropower benefit could increase up to 9.33 million USD per year, respectively, in a wet year. Consequently, the proposed methodology could be a viable approach to promoting the synergistic benefits of the WFE Nexus, and the results provided unique insights for stakeholders and policymakers to pursue sustainable urban development plans. © 2018</abstract>

      <abstract>A UN report states that in 2050, about 70% of the total world population will live in cities. This increases the complexity of the services that the local public administrations have to provide the citizens with to keep an acceptable level of quality of life. For an appropriate design, deployment and management of these services, there is the need for tools to extract data on how the people move, which activities they conduct out and their behaviour (in an anonymous way). This need has justified extensive efforts towards the design of effective solutions for extracting this information. In this work, we present the People Mobility Analytics (PmA) solution, which collects probe requests generated by Wi-Fi devices when scanning the radio channels to detect Access Points. The PmA system processes the collected data to extract key insights on the people mobility, such as: crowd density per area of interest, people flows, time of permanence, time of return, heat maps, origin-destination matrices and estimation of people positions. The major novelty with respect to the state of the art is related to new powerful indicators that are needed for some key city services, such as security management and people transport services, and the experimental activities carried out in real scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>Technological advancements have created notable turning points
throughout the history of humanity. Influential transformations in the
administrative structures are the result of modern technological
discoveries. The artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystems and algorithms
now affect daily lives, communities, and government structures more than
ever. Governments are the main coordinators of technological transition
and supervisors of the activities of modern public administration
systems. Hence, public administration and policies have crucial
responsibilities in integrating, governing, and regulating AI
technology. Integrating AI into public administration and the
policy-making process allows numerous opportunities. However, AI
technology also contains many threats and risks in economic, social, and
even political structures in the long term. This article concentrates on
the big questions of AI in the public administration and policy
literature. The big questions discussion started in 1995 by Robert Behn
drawing attention to the big questions as the primary driving force of a
public administration research agenda. The fundamental motivation of the
big questions approach is shaped by the fact that &#x60;&#x60;questions are as
important as answers.&#39;&#39; This article aims to identify big questions
and discuss potential answers and solutions from an AI governance
research agenda perspective.</abstract>

      <abstract>In Italy, the digital transformation process of public administrations is still unfinished today. The difficulty of implementation is given by a high-speed scientific and technological progress compared to the slow pace of regulations and public administrations to implement the changes. In fact, there are many risks in the digital transition process: the vulnerability of systems, fertile ground for hacker attacks; inadequate protection of users’ privacy with consequent dispersion of sensitive data; the exclusion from the use of the services of fragile categories (such as the elderly, the indigent or the disabled). Hence, the danger of increasing social inequalities which are already very marked in our country. All this also applies to the health sector in which the transition to digital is even more difficult due to the big-organization and delicacy of the protected asset. The need to transfer public health services from the real world to the virtual one has undergone a strong acceleration with the Covid-19 pandemic, during which digital inadequacy was revealed in all its drama in the complex operation to contain the infection. The strengthening of the multiannual budget by Europe and the consequent N.R.R.P of the State represent an unprecedented opportunity to create an innovative, inclusive, equitable and sustainable Health System based on Digital Public Health. However, in order for the N.R.R.P is not a Book of Dreams but a real Plan for development and growth, it is necessary to use the huge appropriations for a profound and structural administrative reorganization in order to make effective that right to “good administration” engraved in art. 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and obtain, in this way, benefits in terms of health protection and the safeguarding of public budgets. © 2024 Ibero-American Law Institute.

      <abstract>: Technological transformations related to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
impact administrative law as algorithms process information that leads
to a new understanding of reality. AI applied to social networks is not
neutral, especially when it comes to the circulation of fake news and
the modulation of will, generating impacts that go beyond the
segmentation of society. The focus of the analysis is centered on the
importance of studying the impact of AI applied to social networks on
the formation of will, which will directly have repercussions regarding
the exercise of citizenship and, consequently, democracy. The objective
is to analyze the use of AI to form public opinion with a focus on the
dissipation of fake news and how this process impacts the legitimacy of
public administration and its processes. Fake news causes
dysfunctionality in Public Administration based on its basic principles:
legality, impersonality, morality, publicity and efficiency. The need to
regulate the matter is justified based on the effects of disinformation,
classified as fatal to democracy: reduction of the population&#39;s
cognitive capacity, influence on the electoral process, harm to
competing political versions and silencing of dissonant voices,
impoverishment of debate and multiplicity of worldviews.</abstract>

      <abstract>This research proposes a framework for the negative impacts of
artificial intelligence (AI) in government by classifying 14 topics of
its dark side into five socio technical categories. The framework is
based on a systematic literature review and highlights that the dark
side is predominantly driven by political, legal, and institutional
aspects, but it is also influenced by data and technology. Lack of
understanding of AI outcomes, biases, and errors, as well as
manipulation of intelligent algorithms and cognitive machines are
contributing factors. The public sector should create knowledge about AI
from an ethical, inclusive, and strategic perspective, involving experts
from different areas. Points for practitioners Government officials and
other decision-makers should be aware of the potential benefits of
artificial intelligence, but also of the dark side, and try to avoid
those potential negative consequences.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big data promises to transform public decision-making for the better by
making it more responsive to actual needs and policy effects. However,
much recent work on big data in public decision-making assumes a
rational view of decision-making, which has been much criticized in the
public administration debate. In this paper, we apply this view, and a
more political one, to the context of big data and offer a qualitative
study. We question the impact of big data on decision-making, realizing
that big data including its new methods and functions must inevitably
encounter existing political and managerial institutions. By studying
two illustrative cases of big data use processes, we explore how these
two worlds meet. Specifically, we look at the interaction between data
analysts and decision makers. In this we distinguish between a rational
view and a political view, and between an information logic and a
decision logic. We find that big data provides ample opportunities for
both analysts and decision makers to do a better job, but this doesn&#39;t
necessarily imply better decision-making, because big data also provides
opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests. Big data enables
both data analysts and decision makers to act as autonomous agents
rather than as links in a functional chain. Therefore, big data&#39;s impact
cannot be interpreted only in terms of its functional promise; it must
also be acknowledged as a phenomenon set to impact our policymaking
institutions, including their legitimacy.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence is increasingly being used by public sector
organisations. Previous research highlighted that the use of AI
technologies in government could improve policy making processes, public
service delivery and the internal management of public administrations.
In this article, we explore to which extent the use of AI in the public
sector impacts these core governance functions. Findings from the review
of a sample of 250 cases across the European Union, show that AI is used
mainly to support improving public service delivery, followed by
enhancing internal management and only in a limited number assist
directly or indirectly policy decision-making. The analysis suggests
that different types of AI technologies and applications are used in
different governance functions, highlighting the need to further
in-depth investigation to better understand the role and impact of use
in what is being defined the governance &#x60;&#x60;of, with and by AI&#39;&#39;.</abstract>

      <abstract>There is great interest to use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
to improve government processes and public services. However, the
adoption of technologies has often been challenging for public
administrations. In this article, the adoption of AI in governmental
organizations has been researched as a form of information and
communication technologies (ICT)-enabled governance innovation in the
public sector. Based on findings from three cases of AI adoption in
public sector organizations, this article shows strong similarities
between the antecedents identified in previous academic literature and
the factors contributing to the use of AI in government. The adoption of
AI in government does not solely rely on having high-quality data but is
facilitated by numerous environmental, organizational, and other factors
that are strictly intertwined among each other. To address the specific
nature of AI in government and the complexity of its adoption in the
public sector, we thus propose a framework to provide a comprehensive
overview of the key factors contributing to the successful adoption of
AI systems, going beyond the narrow focus on data, processing power, and
algorithm development often highlighted in the mainstream AI literature
and policy discourse.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in public administration are
gaining increasing attention due to the potential benefits they can
provide in improving governmental operations. However, translating
technological opportunities into concrete public value for public
administrations is still limited. One of the factors hindering this
progress is the lack of AI capability within public organisations. The
research found that various components of AI capability are essential
for successfully developing and using AI technologies, including
tangible, intangible, and human-related factors. There is a distinction
between the AI capability to develop and the AI capability to implement
AI technologies, with more administrations capable of the former but
finding difficulties in the latter. A lack of in-house technical
expertise to maintain and update the AI systems, legal challenges in
deploying developed AI systems, and the capability to introduce changes
in the organisation to ensure the system remains operational and used by
relevant end-users are among the most critical limiting factors for
long-term use of AI by public administrations. The research underlines
the strong complementarity between historical eGovernment developments
and the capability to deploy AI technologies. The study suggests that
funding alone may not be enough to acquire AI capability, and public
administrations need to focus on both the capability to develop and
implement AI technologies. The research emphasizes that human skillsets,
both technical and non-technical, are essential for the successful
implementation of AI in public administration.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public sector organizations are driven to re-imagine personal data management practices. Among others, responsible personal data management is primordial to foster innovations such as ethical artificial intelligence. Notably, the Flemish government aims to set up a Solid-enabled PDS-based data platform, which is to serve as the foundation of (personal) data sharing ecosystems that respect EU fundamental rights &#39;by design.&#39; Of course, a critical success factor for this novel Flemish data platform is the broad adoption of citizen-centric data storage by public organizations in the region. This article constitutes an exploration of opportunities, challenges, and preconditions for the Flemish public sector through 13 expert interviews. Our findings show that citizen-centric personal data storage is expected to optimize intra-public sector data use, enable proactive public service provision, and foster trust. Challenges relate to a lack of human and financial resources, and data literacy&#x2F; inclusivity issues. For continued public sector engagement in PDS-based data ecosystems, preconditions in terms of moderation of ecosystem openness and data sharing reciprocity, as well as clustering of sub-ecosystems by use-cases, are to be considered. © 2023 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

      <abstract>Purpose This paper aims to analyze the limitations of the mainstream
definition of artificial intelligence (AI) as a rational agent, which
currently drives the development of most AI systems. The authors
advocate the need of a wider range of driving ethical principles for
designing more socially responsible AI agents.
Design&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;approach The authors follow an experience-based line
of reasoning by argument to identify the limitations of the mainstream
definition of AI, which is based on the concept of rational agents that
select, among their designed actions, those which produce the maximum
expected utility in the environment in which they operate. The problem
of biases in the data used by AI is taken as example, and a small proof
of concept with real datasets is provided. Findings The authors observe
that biases measurements on the datasets are sufficient to demonstrate
potential risks of discriminations when using those data in AI rational
agents. Starting from this example, the authors discuss other open
issues connected to AI rational agents and provide a few general ethical
principles derived from the White Paper AI at the service of the
citizen, recently published by Agid, the agency of the Italian
Government which designs and monitors the evolution of the IT systems of
the Public Administration. Originality&#x2F;value The paper contributes to
the scientific debate on the governance and the ethics of AI with a
critical analysis of the mainstream definition of AI.</abstract>

      <abstract>Many people living in urban environments nowadays are overexposed to noise, which results in adverse effects on their health. Thus, urban sound monitoring has emerged as a powerful tool that might enable public administrations to automatically identify and quantify noise pollution. Therefore, identifying multiple and simultaneous acoustic sources in these environments in a reliable and cost-effective way has emerged as a hot research topic. The purpose of this paper is to propose a two-stage classifier able to identify, in real time, a set of up to 21 urban acoustic events that may occur simultaneously (i.e., multilabel), taking advantage of physical redundancy in acoustic sensors from a wireless acoustic sensors network. The first stage of the proposed system consists of a multilabel deep neural network that makes a classification for each 4-s window. The second stage intelligently aggregates the classification results from the first stage of four neighboring nodes to determine the final classification result. Conducted experiments with real-world data and up to three different computing devices show that the system is able to provide classification results in less than 1 s and that it has good performance when classifying the most common events from the dataset. The results of this research may help civic organisations to obtain actionable noise monitoring information from automatic systems. © 2021 by the authors.

      <abstract>Passenger mobility plays an important role in today’s society and optimized transport services are a priority. In recent years, MaaS (Mobility as a Service) has been studied and tested as new integrated services for users. In this paper, MaaS is studied considering the sustainability objectives and goals to be achieved with particular reference to the consolidated methodologies adopted in the transport systems engineering for design, management, and monitoring of transport services; it is defined as Sustainable MaaS (S-MaaS). This paper considers the technological and communication platform essential and assumed to be a given considering that it has been proposed in many papers and it has been tested in some areas together with MaaS. Starting from the MaaS platform, the additional components and models necessary for the implementation of an S-MaaS are analyses in relation to: a Decision Support System (DSS) that supports MaaS public administrations and MaaS companies for the design of the service and demand management; a system for the evaluation of intervention policies; and also considers smart planning for a priori and a posteriori evaluation of sustainability objectives and targets. © 2022 by the author.</abstract>

      <abstract>In recent years, local authorities in the UK have begun to adopt a
variety of &#x60;&#x60;smart&#39;&#39; technological changes to enhance service
delivery. These changes are having profound impacts on the structure of
public administration. Focusing on the particular case of artificial
intelligence, specifically autonomous agents and predictive analytics, a
combination of desk research, a survey questionnaire, and interviews
were used to better understand the extent and nature of these changes in
local government. Findings suggest that local authorities are beginning
to adopt smart technologies and that these technologies are having an
unanticipated impact on how public administrators and computational
algorithms become imbricated in the delivery of public services. This
imbrication is described as algorithmic bureaucracy, and it provides a
framework within which to explore how these technologies transform both
the socio-technical relationship between workers and their tools, as
well as the ways that work is organized in the public sector.</abstract>

      <abstract>Academic and pharmaceutical industry research are both key for progresses in the field of molecular machine learning. Despite common open research questions and long-term goals, the nature and scope of investigations typically differ between academia and industry. Herein, we highlight the opportunities that machine learning models offer to accelerate and improve compound selection. All parts of the model life cycle are discussed, including data preparation, model building, validation, and deployment. Main challenges in molecular machine learning as well as differences between academia and industry are highlighted. Furthermore, application aspects in the design-make-test-analyze cycle are discussed. We close with strategies that could improve collaboration between academic and industrial institutions and will advance the field even further. © 2023</abstract>

      <abstract>Assessment of business community’s subjective perception of state control and supervision impact on the safety of the business environment as part of the ongoing reform of state control and supervisory activities. The study analyzes the results of surveys of small, medium and large enterprises’ managers in 2016-2018, including business entities of various types of economic activity and organizational and legal forms. The vast majority of respondents are small and medium businesses. At the end of 2016, 502 respondents were surveyed, at the end of 2017 – 287 business representatives, and 319 entrepreneurs took part in the survey in 2018. The surveys were initiated by the regional business ombudsman and the business community. A content analysis of the regulatory framework and economic and statistical evaluation of survey results were carried out; tabular and graphical data visualization methods were applied. Results: business representatives do not feel safe in the current business environment. In the subjective perception of entrepreneurs, there is no reduction in the administrative burden on business. At the same time, inspectors remain oriented on the collection of fines and the inspections remain fiscally targeted. There is an interdependence of the subjective perception of control and supervisory measures by business representatives and objective characteristics of the safety of the business environment, which have a significant impact on motivation and the objective results of the activities of economic entities. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

      <abstract>Despite great potential, high hopes and big promises, the actual impact
of big data on the public sector is not always as transformative as the
literature would suggest. In this paper, we ascribe this predicament to
an overly strong emphasis the current literature places on
technical-rational factors at the expense of political decision-making
factors. We express these two different emphases as two archetypical
narratives and use those to illustrate that some political
decision-making factors should be taken seriously by critiquing some of
the core lechno-optimise tenets from a more &#x60;policy-pessimist&#39; angle. In
the conclusion we have these two narratives meet &#x60;eye-to-eye&#39;,
facilitating a more systematized interrogation of big data promises and
shortcomings in further research, paying appropriate attention to both
technical-rational and political decision-making factors. We finish by
offering a realist rejoinder of these two narratives, allowing for more
context-specific scrutiny and balancing both technical-rational and
political decision-making concerns, resulting in more realistic
expectations about using big data for policy-making in practice.</abstract>

      <abstract>Accurate passenger flow forecasting is crucial in urban areas with growing transit demand. In this paper, we propose a method that combines advanced machine learning with rigorous time series analysis to improve prediction accuracy by integrating different datasets, providing a prescriptive example for passenger flow prediction in urban rail transit systems. The study employs advanced machine learning algorithms and proposes a novel prediction model that combines two-stage decomposition (seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS–ensemble empirical mode decomposition (STL-EEMD)) and gated recurrent units. First, the STL decomposition algorithm is applied to break down the preprocessed data into trend terms, periodic terms, and irregular fluctuation terms. Then, the EEMD decomposition algorithm is employed to further decompose the irregular fluctuation terms, yielding multiple IMF components and residual residuals. Subsequently, the decomposed data from STL and EEMD are partitioned into training and test sets and normalized. The training set is utilized to train the model for optimal performance in predicting subway short-time passenger flow. The synthesis of these sophisticated methodologies serves to substantially enhance both the predictive precision and the broad applicability of the forecasting models. The efficacy of the proposed approach is rigorously evaluated through its application to empirical metro passenger flow datasets from diverse urban centers, demonstrating marked superiority in predictive performance over traditional forecasting methods. The insights gleaned from this study bear significant ramifications for the strategic planning and administration of public transportation infrastructures, potentially leading to more strategic resource allocation and an enhanced commuter experience. © 2024 Li Wan et al.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public sector organizations at all levels of government increasingly
rely on Big Data Algorithmic Systems (BDAS) to support decision-making
along the entire policy cycle. But while our knowledge on the use of big
data continues to grow for government agencies implementing and
delivering public services, empirical research on applications for
anticipatory policy design is still in its infancy. Based on the concept
of policy analytical capacity (PAC), this case study examines the
application of BDAS for early crisis detection within the German Federal
Government-that is, the German Federal Foreign Office (FFO) and the
Federal Ministry of Defence (FMoD). It uses the nested model of PAC to
reflect on systemic, organizational, and individual capacity-building
from a neoinstitutional perspective and allow for the consideration of
embedded institutional contexts. Results from semi-structured interviews
indicate that governments seeking to exploit BDAS in policymaking depend
on their institutional environment (e.g., through research and data
governance infrastructure). However, specific capacity-building
strategies may differ according to the departments&#39; institutional
framework, with the FMoD relying heavily on subordinate agencies and the
FFO creating network-like structures with external researchers.
Government capacity-building at the individual and organizational level
is similarly affected by long-established institutional structures,
roles, and practices within the organization and beyond, making it
important to analyze these three levels simultaneously instead of
separately.</abstract>

      <abstract>Despite significant theoretical and empirical attention on public value
creation in the public sector, the relationship between artificial
intelligence (AI) use and value creation from the citizen perspective
remains poorly understood. We ground our study in Moore&#39;s public value
management to examine the relationship between AI use and value
creation. We conceptually categorize public service value into public
value and private value. We use procedural justice and trust in
government as indicators of public value and, based on motivation
theory, we use perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment as
indicators of private value. A field survey of 492 AI voice robot users
in China was conducted to test our model. The results indicated that the
effective use of AI voice robots was significantly associated with
private value and procedural justice. However, the relationship between
the effective use of AI and trust in government was not found to be
significant. Surprisingly, the respondents indicated that private value
had a greater effect on overall value creation than public value. This
contrasts with the common idea that value creation from the government
perspective suggests that social objectives requiring public value are
more important to citizens. The results also show that gender and
citizens with different experiences show different AI usage behaviors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in public services are an
emerging and crucial issue in the modern world. Many countries utilize
AI-enabled systems to serve citizens and deliver public services.
Although AI can bring more efficiency and responsiveness, this
technology raises privacy and social inequality concerns. From the
perspective of behavioral public administration (BPA), citizens&#39; use of
AI-enabled systems depends on their perception of this technology. This
study proposes a conceptual framework connecting citizens&#39; perceptions,
trust, and intention to follow instructions from the
government-supported AI-enabled recommendation system in the pandemic.
Our study launches an online-based experimental survey and analyzes the
data with the partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM).
The research findings suggest that algorithmic transparency increases
trust in the recommendations, but privacy concerns decrease the trust
when the system asks for sensitive information. Additionally, citizens
familiar with technologies are more likely to trust the recommendations
in the feature-based communication strategy. Finally, trust in the
recommendations can mediate the impacts of citizens&#39; perceptions of the
AI system. This study clarifies the effects of perceptions, identifies
the role of trust, and explores the communication strategies in
citizens&#39; intention to follow the AI-enabled system recommendations. The
results can deepen AI research in public administration and provide
policy suggestions for the public sector to develop strategies to
increase policy compliance with system recommendations.</abstract>

      <abstract>Big data technology has become increasingly prevalent in facilitating
the delivery of government services and public goods in China and
beyond. This article seeks to examine how big data can be leveraged in
poverty governance in rural China, and what the political implications
are. This phenomenon of big data-driven welfare governance is
particularly salient considering the broader context of governmental
digital transformation, both within China and globally. This research
sheds light on how big data usage functions in poverty alleviation,
highlighting general motivations and developments in Chinese
data-centric welfare governance. More importantly, this article
introduces the novel concept of &#x60;&#x60;digital cybernetic capacity&#39;&#39; to
examine public sector modernization as big data transforms the landscape
of welfare delivery and governance. By delving into the intersection
between technology and social welfare, we explicate how the use of big
data in social welfare policies can go beyond merely improving
information capacity to redefine state capacity. This article argues
that such a new governance ecosystem, driven as it is by data
technologies, not only provides insights about the transformative
resilience of Chinese governance but also opens a new theoretical
frontier for research into other countries.</abstract>

      <abstract>Urban prediction tasks refer to predicting urban indicators ( e.g. ,
traffic, temperature, etc.) using urban big data, which is crucial for
understanding the urban patterns, and further benefits the urban public
administration. An empirical study indicates that there are correlated
patterns among urban prediction tasks from various domains, which
suggests the existence of domain -sharing knowledge. Aggregating such
domain -sharing knowledge would significantly benefit urban prediction
tasks. However, as a widely used learning paradigm for knowledge
aggregation, existing meta -learning methods, especially gradient -based
methods, can only work for singledomain tasks. To solve the problem, we
propose Cross -Domain Meta -Learning (CDML), a flexible framework for
aggregating domain -sharing knowledge from cross -domain urban
prediction tasks. Specifically, the core architecture of CDML is the
model fusion block that includes (1) meta -model, shared by cross
-domain tasks for capturing domain -sharing knowledge; (2) domain
-specific model, shared only by the same -domain tasks for preserving
domain -specific knowledge; and (3) knowledge fusion unit, for combining
both the domainsharing&#x2F;specific knowledge for good generalization.
Moreover, we develop asynchronous meta -training and adaption strategy
strategies to further guarantee cross -domain generalization. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework with the superior ability of boosting existing urban
prediction models, quick adaption, and the potential for simplifying
models.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have been emerging in these past years and affecting multiple dimensions of the public sector. The government utilizes AI to transform policy implementation and service delivery, but AI can also threaten citizens’ privacy and social equity due to its potential biases. These concerns increase citizens’ perceived uncertainty concerning AI. In an uncertain environment, trust transfer serves as a way to improve citizens’ trust in AI-enabled government systems. However, little research has explored trust transfer between the public sector and the system. This study examines whether a context-based trust transfer mechanism can explain the trust-building of the AI-enabled government system. The study conducted a survey and analyzed the collected data using factor-score-based regression analysis. The research results indicate that trust transfer occurs for the AI-enabled government system. Trust in an administrative process, local government, and political leaders can be transferred to trust in governmental AI systems. The findings can advance the theoretical development of trust transfer theory and be used to develop recommendations for the public sector. © 2024 – IOS Press. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>According to the ever-growing supply and demand of IoT content, IoT big data in diversified applications are deemed a valuable asset by private and public sectors. Their privacy protection has been a hot research topic. Inspired by previous work on bounded-error-pruned IoT content market, we observe that the anonymity protection with robust watermarking can be developed by further pruning data for better resource-efficient IoT big data without violating the required quality of sensor service or quality of decision-making. In this paper, resource-efficient anonymity protection with watermarking is thus proposed for data consumers and owners of IoT big data market via blockchain. Our proposed scheme can provide the IoT data with privacy protections of both anonymity and ownership in IoT big data market with resource efficiency. The experiments of four different-type IoT datasets with different settings included bounded-errors, sub-stream sizes, watermark lengths, and ratios of data tampering. The performance results demonstrated that our proposed scheme can provide data owners and consumers with ownership and anonymity via watermarking the IoT big data streams for lossless compressibility. Meanwhile, the developed DApp with our proposed scheme on the Ethereum blockchain can help data owners freely share and trade with consumers in convenience with availability, reliability, and security without mutual trust. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The issuance and implementation of intellectual property policies have promoted the rapid development of intellectual property intermediary services in China, bringing new opportunities and challenges for public sectors of the government. With their continuous development, Internet of Things (IoT) technology and big data have become the analytical tools widely applied in many technical fields. Through the analysis of IoT data, the optimal resource configuration could be obtained, which would guide both governments and enterprise managers to make scientific decisions in terms of future development. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>In today’s fast moving environment, organizations either thrive or fail depending on how they manage information. Information is a critical and strategic organizational asset and must be harnessed as a business asset. This requires action and leadership at Board level. In 1995, a pivotal report, the Hawley report, argued this case forcibly and presented an agenda for Board action developed through discussion among 30 UK private and public sector organizations working within a KPMG IMPACT programme. Actions to ensure that Board operation was underpinned by sufficient and valid information were accompanied by recommended measures to ensure information assets were well and legally managed and deployed to advantage at every level of operations. A successor report has just been published by the Chartered Institute of Information Professionals, KPMG, CIO Connect and IK SpringBoard supported by the Network for Information and Knowledge Exchange. It reinforces the responsibilities of Boards in leading their organization’s information vision, policy, strategy and governance. This article explains why senior leadership is so vital as the fourth industrial age is followed by the fifth and the power of information is transformed through artificial intelligence and Interconnection. © The Author(s) 2019.</abstract>

      <abstract>LIS education has invested heavily in workforce development for data services in research institutions, however little work has been done on open data competencies needed in public libraries and government agencies. The Open Data Literacy (ODL) project is working to prepare students to build infrastructure and to curate and sustain open data resources for the public by advancing data curation and data science curriculum and providing field experiences in collaboration with city and state agencies. To determine the expertise students need to meet workforce demands, we are examining the current data challenges faced by these public sector organizations. Based on the first year of student field experiences, we found that data organization and access, data quality, and data visualization were prominent areas of competency needed across the sites. While these areas are captured to some degree in current frameworks meant to catalog “data expertise” we find that additional competencies are required, in particular the need for developing and following metadata standards, evaluation and use of storage and cloud services, APIs, law and ethics, and public sector and not-for-profit organization knowledge. In future work these emerging areas of data expertise will be prioritized and deepened in our curriculum and better articulated for application in data education more generally.

      <abstract>Business leaders and policymakers within service economies are placing greater emphasis on well-being, given the role of workers in such settings. Whilst people&#39;s well-being can lead to economic growth, it can also have the opposite effect if overlooked. Therefore, enhancing subjective well-being (SWB) is pertinent for all organisations for the sustainable development of an economy. While health conditions were previously deemed the most reliable predictors, the availability of data on people&#39;s personal lifestyles now offers a new dimension into well-being for organisations. Using open data available from the national Annual Population Survey in the UK, which measures SWB, this research uncovered that among several independent variables to predict varying levels of people&#39;s perceived well-being, long-term health conditions, one&#39;s marital status, and age played a key role in SWB. The proposed model provides the key indicators of measuring SWB for organisations using big data. © 2020</abstract>

      <abstract>How to efficiently process big data at a low cost is a substantial
challenge. Many efficient and economical data processing approaches have
been proposed in the fields including business, scientific research, and
public administration. Unfortunately, seismic data processing has not
achieved the same level of devolvement in the field of oil exploration.
While many storage architectures, such as network-attached storage (NAS)
and storage area network (SAN), have been widely used to process massive
amounts of seismic data, these architectures are expensive in terms of
bandwidth and capacity. In this paper, we propose a high-bandwidth and
low-cost approach to fill this gap. NASStore is our data store built on
NAS for processing seismic data. However, it cannot provide a high
bandwidth at a low cost when it comes to data-intensive computing
scenarios due to the massive bandwidth requirement and the huge volume
of data to be stored. Distributed file systems, such as the Hadoop
Distributed File System (HDFS), offer an alternative approach to store
data. It delivers high aggregate performance to user applications while
running on inexpensive commodity hardware. In order to overcome the
shortcomings of NASStore, we first present HDFSStore that is built on
HDFS for processing seismic data. We then couple NASStore and HDFSStore
to construct a new hybrid data store, called SeisStore, in which
efficient parallel write, read, and update mechanisms are employed to
improve the system performance. The experiment results show that
SeisStore reduces the storage cost than NASStore by up to 23.20% and
improves the access bandwidth than NASStore and HDFSStore by up to
478.84% and 16.99%, respectively.</abstract>

      <abstract>Urban bus networks play an important role, when the capacity of urban public services is evaluated. With recent advancements in Internet and Communication Technologies, there is an emerging interest in building an urban bus network model through open big data. This has rarely been investigated and exposes several challenges in the provision of transportation services in urban planning. On the one hand, it is necessary to combine bus stations based on spatial distance constraints due to their ambiguous definition in open big data; on the other hand, it is difficult and time-consuming to relocate and build new stations, but the optimization of bus lines is relatively easy to implement. This study aimed to develop an explicit methodological framework for building and analyzing two different types of urban bus network model using open big data. Thereafter, the framework was applied in two case studies in China, within a county-level administration and in a region including three county-level administrations. The key result shows that there was a shortage of urban bus services across these different administrations. This paper contributes to the body of research methodologies into public transport networks and to understanding the sharing of urban public services across administrations, improving the management of urban bus networks, and highlighting the importance of examining the characteristics of urban bus network in county-level administrations rather than just in large cities in China. © 2020 Sheng Wei et al.</abstract>

      <abstract>Around the world there are more than 100 policy labs-multi-disciplinary
government teams developing public services and policies using
innovation methods to engage citizens and stakeholders. These policy
labs use a range of innovation methods and approaches, including
co-production, co-creation, co-design, behavioural insights, systems
thinking, ethnography, data science, nudge theory and lean processes.
Although the methods may vary, one element is consistent: policy labs
actively, creatively and collaboratively engage the public and a wide
range of stakeholders in jointly developing solutions. The Northern
Ireland Public Sector Innovation Lab (iLab) is part of a growing UK and
international community of policy labs using co-design to engage with
users for value co-creation, aiming to improve public governance by
creating a safe space to generate ideas, test prototypes and refine
concepts with beneficiaries. Drawing on iLab&#39;s experience, this paper
explores three questions: What are the main determinants of effective
co-design? What are the unintended consequences of co-design? And what
lessons can be learned from iLab and shared with other policy labs?
IMPACT There is a need to reinstate the legitimacy of public
policy-making and public service development through more effective
citizen engagement. To experiment with more creative and user-centred
approaches, governments are establishing Policy Labs to engage citizens
at multiple stages of the development process. The Northern Ireland
Public Sector Innovation Lab (iLab) is part of a growing UK and
international community of Policy Labs using co-design to engage with
users for value co-creation, aiming to improve public governance by
creating a safe space to generate ideas, test prototypes and refine
concepts with beneficiaries.</abstract>

      <abstract>Ethics, explainability, responsibility, and accountability are important
concepts for questioning the societal impacts of artificial intelligence
and machine learning (AI), but are insufficient to guide the public
sector in regulating and implementing AI. Recent frameworks for AI
governance help to operationalize these by identifying the processes and
layers of governance in which they must be considered, but do not
provide public sector workers with guidance on how they should be
pursued or understood. This analysis explores how the concept of
sustainable AI can help to fill this gap. It does so by reviewing how
the concept has been used by the research community and aligning
research on sustainable development with research on public sector AI.
Doing so identifies the utility of boundary conditions that have been
asserted for social sustainability according to the Framework for
Strategic Sustainable Development, and which are here integrated with
prominent concepts from the discourse on AI and society. This results in
a conceptual model that integrates five boundary conditions to assist
public sector decision-making about how to govern AI: Diversity,
Capacity for learning, Capacity for selforganization Common meaning, and
Trust. These are presented together with practical approaches for their
presentation, and guiding questions to aid public sector workers in
making the decisions that are required by other operational frameworks
for ethical AI.</abstract>

      <abstract>This analysis applies boundary theory to public manager efforts to overcome AI capacity gaps through a public sector collaborative learning forum. Administrative and interview data identify the types of knowledge managers are able to access, the types of organizational differences that influence learning, and the strategies public managers use to overcome them. Analysis suggests that unstructured learning fora are better suited to the transfer of tacit procedural knowledge than declarative knowledge about AI, and emphasizes the importance of social trust and network structure to overcome knowledge gaps through peer learning. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>While the public sector traditionally lags behind business in innovation, significant changes are anticipated with the broad diffusion of so-called disruptive technologies. The use of such technologies in public service, along with possible benefits, need to be well researched, and challenges be carefully discussed, analysed and evaluated. This paper applies scenario-based science and technology roadmapping to identify research and training needs in the implementation of disruptive technologies in public service. 70 experts reviewed 13 future scenarios and derived a number of research and training needs regarding internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, big data and other disruptive technologies. The identified needs serve as a starting point for a broader and more informed discussion about how such new (disruptive) technologies can be successfully deployed in the public sector-leveraging the benefits of these technologies while at the same time constraining the drawbacks affiliated with them. © 2020, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

      <abstract>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted great attention
from researchers and practitioners and have opened up a broad range of
beneficial opportunities for AI usage in the public sector. Against this
background, there is an emerging need for a holistic understanding of
the range and impact of AI-based applications and associated challenges.
However, previous research considers AI applications and challenges only
in isolation and fragmentarily. Given the lack of a comprehensive
overview of AI-based applications and challenges for the public sector,
our conceptual approach analyzes and compiles relevant insights from
scientific literature to provide an integrative overview of AI
applications and related challenges. Our results suggest 10 AI
application areas, describing their value creation and functioning as
well as specific public use cases. In addition, we identify four major
dimensions of AI challenges. We finally discuss our findings, deriving
implications for theory and practice and providing suggestions for
future research.</abstract>

      <abstract>As government and public administration lag behind the rapid development
of AI in their efforts to provide adequate governance, they need
respective concepts to keep pace with this dynamic progress. The
literature provides few answers to the question of how government and
public administration should respond to the great challenges associated
with AI and use regulation to prevent harm. This study analyzes AI
challenges and former AI regulation approaches. Based on this analysis
and regulation theory, an integrated AI governance framework is
developed that compiles key aspects of AI governance and provides a
guide for the regulatory process of AI and its application. The article
concludes with theoretical implications and recommendations for public
officers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) extends the limits of current performance
in data processing and analysis many times over. Since this states a
great improvement in managing public data, this conceptual study
discusses the use of AI in public management structures in connection
with their risks and side effects. The exercise of state power and
public influence through intelligent machines make ethical and political
guidelines essential for their operation, constituting the cornerstones
of the AI framework model developed here. The organizational structure
and technical specification are additional aspects of the AI that
determine design and functionality of the framework model in practical
application.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study addresses the growing challenge of governing artificial
intelligence (AI) arising from the risks that it increasingly poses to
the public sector and society. Based on an in-depth literature analysis,
we first identify AI risks and guidelines and classify them into six
categories, including technological, data, and analytical risks and
guidelines, informational and communicational risks and guidelines,
economic risks and guidelines, social risks and guidelines, ethical
risks and guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory risks and
guidelines. These risks and guidelines are then elaborated and
transferred into a four-layered conceptual framework for AI governance.
The framework interrelates AI risks and AI guidelines by means of a risk
management and guidance process, resulting in an AI governance layer
depicting the process for implementation of customised risk mitigation
guidelines. The framework constitutes a comprehensive reference point
for developing and implementing AI governance strategies and measures in
the public sector.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for the
public sector. As the number of studies in this field increases, this
study provides a systematic overview of the current literature on AI in
the public sector. Therefore, key findings and implications of the
literature are highlighted and recommendations for further research are
provided. The study is based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis
of 189 selected articles. It draws on findings from previous review
studies and compares them with new findings from current studies.
Overall, it shows that the current state of research is heterogeneous
and thematically and methodologically unbalanced. Many studies on AI in
the government context focus on governance and administration, while
more specific application areas receive less attention. Studies to date
focus in detail on changes to existing government structures, while the
creation of entirely new structures due to new AI technologies is given
less consideration.</abstract>

      <abstract>Background: Fraud in financial transaction is at the root of corruption issues recorded in organization. Detecting fraud practices has become increasingly complex and challenging. As a result, auditors require precise analytical tools for fraud detection. Grouping financial transaction data using K-Means Clustering algorithm can enhance the efficiency of applying Benford Law for optimal fraud detection. Objective: This study aimed to introduce Multiple Benford Law Model for the analysis of data to show potential concealed fraud in the audited organization financial transaction. The data was categorized into low, medium, and high transaction values using K-Means Clustering algorithm. Subsequently, it was reanalyzed through Multiple Benford Law Model in a specialized fraud analysis tool. Methods: In this study, the experimental procedures of Multiple Benford Law Model designed for public sector organizations were applied. The analysis of suspected fraud generated by the toolkit was compared with the actual conditions reported in audit report. The financial transaction dataset was prepared and grouped into three distinct clusters using the Euclidean distance equation. Data in these clusters was analyzed using Benford Law, comparing the frequency of the first digit’s occurrence to the expected frequency based on Benford Law. Significant deviations exceeding ±5% were considered potential areas for further scrutiny in audit. Furthermore, the analysis were validated by cross-referencing the result with the findings presented in the authorized audit organization report. Results: Multiple Benford Law Model developed was incorporated into an audit toolkit to automated calculations based on Benford Law. Furthermore, the datasets were categorized using K-Means Clustering algorithm into three clusters representing low, medium, and high-value transaction data. Results from the application of Benford Law showed a 40.00% potential for fraud detection. However, when using Multiple Benford Law Model and dividing the data into three clusters, fraud detection accuracy increased to 93.33%. The comparative results in audit report indicated a 75.00% consistency with the actual events or facts discovered. Conclusion: The use of Multiple Benford Law Model in audit toolkit substantially improved the accuracy of detecting potential fraud in financial transaction.

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) - computerised technology that imitates
aspects of human intelligence - is developing at a rapid pace. It is
increasingly used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
multifarious processes in private industry and public administration.
Among the statutory authorities that have begun to explore the potential
for AI to assist them are regulators of Australia&#39;s health professions.
Protection of the public is a chief objective of this area of
administrative law. This section considers some possible uses of AI -
and particularly its capacities to analyse and draw inferences from
data, make predictions and decisions, and automate tasks - that might
help regulators achieve this goal. The section also contemplates the
implications of AI involvement in the regulation of health practitioners
for the rule of law and human rights it protects and recommends measures
that might be taken to mitigate risks of their infringement.</abstract>

      <abstract>While the Big Data revolution is transforming public policy, some debates and competing perspectives on the impact of the disruptive technology of Big Data analytics remain. Although trade-offs among objectives are inevitable in Big Data applications, its ultimate impact would depend on the moderating factors, which vary across contexts such as policy areas and national systems. Integrating the literature from multiple disciplines, this article identifies some of the critical moderating factors accounting for the differentials of Big Data impacts and develops a typology of its applications in public policy as a heuristic to understand and reconcile competing perspectives. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, artificial intelligence-assisted rule-based confidence
metric (AI-CRBM) framework has been introduced for analyzing
environmental governance expense prediction reform. A metric method is
to assess a level of collective environmental governance representing
general, government, and corporate aspects. The equilibrium approach is
used to calculate improvements in the source of environmental management
based on cost, and it is tailored to test the public sector-corporation
for environmental shared governance. The overall concept of cost
prediction or estimation of environmental governance is achieved by the
rule-based confidence method. The framework compares the expected cost
to the environment of governance to determine the efficiency of the cost
prediction process.</abstract>

      <abstract>With the obvious regionalization trend in the new period of urbanization in China, the scientific delineation of functional regions (FRs) at different scales has become a heated topic recently. Since the 20th century, western academia has formed a basic idea of metropolitan areas&#39; (MAs) delineation based on population density and commuting rate, for which the subjectivity of threshold setting is difficult to overcome. In this study, community detection algorithms from the field of network science are employed, namely the Louvain algorithm with adjustable resolutions and Combo with high-precision output, respectively. We take the nationwide car-hailing data set as an example to explore a bottom-up method for delineating regional economic geography at different scales based on the interconnection strength between nodes. It was found that most of the prefecture-level cities in China have a dominant commuting region and two or three secondary commuting sub-regions, while regional central cities have extended their commuting hinterlands over jurisdictional boundaries, which is not common due to the larger initial administrative divisions and the comprehensive development niveau of cities. The feasibility and limitation of community detection partitioning algorithms in the application of regional science are verified. It is supposed to be widely used in regional delimitation supported by big data. Both of the two algorithms show a shortage of ignorance of spatial proximity. It is necessary to explore new algorithms that can adjust both accuracy and spatial distance as parameters. © 2019 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to integrate the concepts of planetary health and big data into the Donabedian model to evaluate the Brazilian dengue control program in the state of São Paulo. METHODS: Data science methods were used to integrate and analyze dengue-related data, adding context to the structure and outcome components of the Donabedian model. This data, considering the period from 2010 to 2019, was collected from sources such as Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS), the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), WorldClim, and MapBiomas. These data were integrated into a Data Warehouse. K-means algorithm was used to identify groups with similar contexts. Then, statistical analyses and spatial visualizations of the groups were performed, considering socioeconomic and demographic variables, soil, health structure, and dengue cases. OUTCOMES: Using climate variables, the K-means algorithm identified four groups of municipalities with similar characteristics. The comparison of their indicators revealed certain patterns in the municipalities with the worst performance in terms of dengue case outcomes. Although presenting better economic conditions, these municipalities held a lower average number of community healthcare agents and basic health units per inhabitant. Thus, economic conditions did not reflect better health structure among the three studied indicators. Another characteristic of these municipalities is urbanization. The worst performing municipalities presented a higher rate of urban population and human activity related to urbanization. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology identified important deficiencies in the implementation of the dengue control program in the state of São Paulo. The integration of several databases and the use of Data Science methods allowed the evaluation of the program on a large scale, considering the context in which activities are conducted. These data can be used by the public administration to plan actions and invest according to the deficiencies of each location. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided that the original author and source are credited.</abstract>

      <abstract>As a new economic form, the digital economy has become an important manifestation of national comprehensive strength, which is an absolute key force to enhance international competitiveness and reshape the international economic landscape in the digital era. Hundreds of schools of thought contend on the digital economy, and a consensus theory and framework has not yet been formed. In order to clarify the development venation and research status of the digital economy, and highlight the key points of digital economy research field in the future, this paper conducts bibliometric analysis and visualization by using Cite Space on digital economy connotation and extension mainly from four respects: the period characteristics of published articles, the distribution characteristics of articles, the characteristics of keyword changes, and the evolution characteristics of research directions. We take the WOS Core Collection as the database, and sets the subject headings with the digital economy connotation and extension as the retrieval target, and finally obtained 918 and 10,735 articles respectively as of 2022. We find that (a) the research on the connotation of the digital economy has experienced a long incubation and germination period, while the denotation period has maintained a long period of popularity, and both have ushered in a research climax in recent years; (b) the research team on the connotation of the digital economy is relatively scattered, and there is no unified consensus on the connotation of the digital economy, while the connection between the denotation period teams is relatively close; (c) from the perspective of keywords, “internet” and “big data” have caused a local upsurge in digital economy research. Otherwise, the denotation period hotspot of the digital economy is about 15 years earlier than the connotation research on average, which provides fertile soil for the formation, development and maturity of the digital economy connotation; (d) judging from the citation frequency of references, the total number of research articles on the connotation of the digital economy published after 2017 is relatively high and relatively concentrated, and a consensus on the understanding of the connotation of the digital economy has begun to form; (e) from the perspective of the evolution of research directions, “Information Science Library Science”, “Computer Science” and “Government Law” are the research hotspots in recent years, and “Public Administration” and “Engineering” may be the research growth points in the next few years. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>

      <abstract>To retrieve the right collection of publications in interdisciplinary research, we have developed a search strategy with four progressive steps and take the area of public affairs (PA) as a case study. A set of seed publications in PA is first identified, followed by the construction of a pool set of publications with wider coverage for refinement in the next step, which is critical and in which an expanded set of publications is established on the basis of the references and text semantic information, thus generating two respective subsets. One of these subsets is obtained on the basis of the number of references shared between each publication pair between the seed set and the pool set. To optimize the results, we construct two models, viz. a support vector machine (SVM) and a fully connected neural network (FCNN), and find that the FCNN model outperforms the SVM model. The second subset of publications are collected by selecting the publications with high topic similarity to the seed publications collected in the first step. The final step is to integrate the seed publications with the expanded publications collected in steps 1 and 3. The results show that PA research involves an extremely wide range of disciplines (n &#x3D; 45), among which public administration, environmental sciences, economics, management, and health policy and services, among others, play the most significant roles. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

      <abstract>In the Internet age, social needs have become more diverse. The private sector has achieved great success in integrating resources to provide services to customers thanks to technological breakthroughs such as mobile Internet and big data, while the public sector has become even more dwarfed. The public sector urgently needs new theoretical support to integrate administrative resources more effectively, so as to provide the public with one-stop, holistic and seamless services as a whole. The &quot;holistic governance&quot;theory effectively responded to the abovementioned problems and gradually condensed the consensus of the academic and practical circles and became the most influential theory. The method of mathematical modeling is used to combine the improved wavelet domain Wiener filter and the comprehensive model of partial differential equations. This paper proposes an image recognition algorithm based on partial differential equations and wavelet transform. The algorithm uses weight coefficients to organically combine high-order partial differential equation models, retains the advantages of the second- and fourth-order partial differential recognition models, effectively improves the ability to maintain image edge detail information, and achieves better recognition results. This article starts with the description of the fragmentation of a street&#39;s grassroots governance and sorts out the process of implementing overall governance with the &quot;big linkage mechanism&quot;as the main carrier. Due to the limitations of research ability and objective conditions, this article intercepts the &quot;cross-section&quot;of the big linkage mechanism in a certain street to demonstrate it and analyzes this &quot;cross-section&quot;more thoroughly. The experimental results of the data show that the image recognition algorithm based on partial differential equations and wavelet transform is effective and practical in the intelligent linkage system of the government urban public management.  © 2021 Xinyu Xu.</abstract>

      <abstract>The concrete aging problem has gained more attention in recent years as more bridges and tunnels in the United States lack proper maintenance. Though the Federal Highway Administration requires these public concrete structures to be inspected regularly, on-site manual inspection by human operators is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Conventional inspection approaches for concrete inspection, using RGB image-based thresholding methods, are not able to determine metric information as well as accurate location information for assessed defects for conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) based concrete inspection system using a quadrotor flying robot (referred to as CityFlyer) mounted with an RGB-D camera. The inspection system introduces several novel modules. Firstly, a visual-inertial fusion approach is introduced to perform camera and robot positioning and structure 3D metric reconstruction. The reconstructed map is used to retrieve the location and metric information of the defects. Secondly, we introduce a DNN model, namely AdaNet, to detect concrete spalling and cracking, with the capability of maintaining robustness under various distances between the camera and concrete surface. In order to train the model, we craft a new dataset, i.e., the concrete structure spalling and cracking (CSSC) dataset, which is released publicly to the research community. Finally, we introduce a 3D semantic mapping method using the annotated framework to reconstruct the concrete structure for visualization. We performed comparative studies and demonstrated that our AdaNet can achieve 8.41 higher detection accuracy than ResNets and VGGs. Moreover, we conducted five field tests, of which three are manual hand-held tests and two are drone-based field tests. These results indicate that our system is capable of performing metric field inspection, and can serve as an effective tool for civil engineers. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Using Taiwan&#39;s Manpower Utilization Survey from 2012-2014, this paper investigates the impacts that salary variation caused by insufficient information, then evaluates the condition of information holding between the employee and the employer. The results indicate that the ignorance of employee and employer are deeper in the private sector than that in the public sector; the employees and employer ignorance with the white-collar both larger than the blue-collar. Besides, the results demonstrate insignificantly effect in both ignorance estimation in the public sector, which may reflect the labors enter to the public sector mainly through national examination and cause the insignificant estimation. © 2019-IOS Press and the authors.

      <abstract>In this paper, we perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling on
Twitter and Facebook posts of nine public sector organizations operating
in Northeast US. The study objective is to compare and contrast message
sentiment, content and topics of discussion on social media. We discover
that sentiment and frequency of messages on social media is indeed
affected by nature of organization&#39;s operations. We also discover that
organizations either use Twitter for broadcasting or one-to-one
communication with public. Finally we found discussion topics of
organizations - identified through unsupervised machine learning - that
engaged in similar areas of public service having similar topics and
keywords in their public messages. Our analysis also indicates missed
opportunities by these organizations when communication with public.
Findings from this study can be used by public sector entities to
understand and improve their social media engagement with citizens.</abstract>

      <abstract>The issue of public procurement effectiveness is becoming increasingly relevant in the context of the observed budget deficit in Kazakhstan. In this article, business processes related to ensuring the best combination of low price and quality in public procurement as the main indicators of procurement efficiency are studied and described in more depth. Considering the problems of public procurement efficiency, many researchers analyze the supplier identification stage. However, in the procurement of works, the execution phase is equally, if not more, important for efficiency. Analysis of the work execution process in Kazakhstan revealed problems related to quality control of the work performed and the construction materials used, as well as limited competition in their procurement. The high degree of the human factor&#39;s presence in the quality assurance process and the low availability of information about the demand for goods creates the risk of purchasing poor-quality goods at a high price. While the effectiveness of using big data in the decision-making process is universally proven, information in the public procurement system is not accumulated properly. In this regard, to ensure the best combination of price and quality of work, the authors propose a model of public procurement of works using digital tools. © 2022 Uspekhi Khimii, ZIOC RAS, Russian Academy of Sciences.</abstract>

      <abstract>The use of the artificial technology in the public administration is currently limited due to several barriers that prevent the decision makers from adopting it. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the clerkless public offices where the concept of the public administration is applied though a synergy of the AI and other technologies aiming at the improvement of the citizen’s service even in extreme conditions such as pandemics and physical disasters. The suggested design is an augmentation of the clerkless Amazon Go store and the recent state of the art in e-government.

      <abstract>Highly sophisticated capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) have
skyrocketed its popularity across many industry sectors globally. The
public sector is one of these. Many cities around the world are trying
to position themselves as leaders of urban innovation through the
development and deployment of AI systems. Likewise, increasing numbers
of local government agencies are attempting to utilise AI technologies
in their operations to deliver policy and generate efficiencies in
highly uncertain and complex urban environments. While the popularity of
AI is on the rise in urban policy circles, there is limited
understanding and lack of empirical studies on the city manager
perceptions concerning urban AI systems. Bridging this gap is the
rationale of this study. The methodological approach adopted in this
study is twofold. First, the study collects data through semi-structured
interviews with city managers from Australia and the US. Then, the study
analyses the data using the summative content analysis technique with
two data analysis software. The analysis identifies the following themes
and generates insights into local government services: AI adoption
areas, cautionary areas, challenges, effects, impacts, knowledge basis,
plans, preparedness, roadblocks, technologies, deployment timeframes,
and usefulness. The study findings inform city managers in their efforts
to deploy AI in their local government operations, and offer directions
for prospective research.</abstract>

      <abstract>Making forecasts for the development of a given process over time, which
depends on many factors, is in some cases a difficult task. The choice
of appropriate methods-mathematical, statistical, or artificial
intelligence methods-is also not obvious, given their great variety.
This paper presented a model of a forecasting system by comparing the
errors in the use of time series on the one hand, and artificial neural
networks on the other. The model aims at multifactor predictions based
on forecast data on significant factors, which were obtained by
automated testing of different methods and selection of the methods with
the highest accuracy. Successful experiments were conducted to forecast
energy consumption in Bulgaria, including for household consumption;
industry consumption, the public sector and services; and total final
energy consumption.</abstract>

      <abstract>Public administration research has documented a shift in the locus of
discretion away from street-level bureaucrats to &#x60;&#x60;systems-level
bureaucracies&#39;&#39; as a result of new information communication
technologies that automate bureaucratic processes, and thus shape access
to resources and decisions around enforcement and punishment. Advances
in artificial intelligence (AI) are accelerating these trends,
potentially altering discretion in public management in exciting and in
challenging ways. We introduce the concept of &#x60;&#x60;artificial
discretion&#39;&#39; as a theoretical framework to help public managers
consider the impact of Al as they face decisions about whether and how
to implement it. We operationalize discretion as the execution of tasks
that require nontrivial decisions. Using Salamon&#39;s tools of governance
framework, we compare artificial discretion to human discretion as task
specificity and environmental complexity vary. We evaluate artificial
discretion with the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, equity,
manageability, and political feasibility. Our analysis suggests three
principal ways that artificial discretion can improve administrative
discretion at the task level: (1) increasing scalability, (2) decreasing
cost, and (3) improving quality. At the same time, artificial discretion
raises serious concerns with respect to equity, manageability, and
political feasibility.</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) offers challenges and benefits to the
public sector. We present an ethical framework to analyze the effects of
AI in public organizations, guide empirical and theoretical research in
public administration, and inform practitioner deliberation and decision
making on AI adoption. We put forward six propositions on how the use of
AI by public organizations may facilitate or prevent unnecessary harm.
The framework builds on the theory of administrative evil and
contributes to it in two ways. First, we interpret the theory of
administrative evil through the lens of agency theory. We examine how
the mechanisms stipulated by the former relate to the underlying
mechanisms of the latter. Specifically, we highlight how mechanisms of
administrative evil can be analyzed as information problems in the form
of adverse selection and moral hazard. Second, we describe possible
causal pathways of the theory of administrative evil and associate each
with a level of analysis: individual (micro), organizational (meso), and
cultural (macro). We then develop both descriptive and normative
propositions on AI&#39;s potential to increase or decrease the risk of
administrative evil. The article hence contributes an institutional and
public administration lens to the growing literature on AI safety and
value alignment.</abstract>

      <abstract>The so-called strength of weak ties (SWT) theory asserts that weak relationships are more instrumental than strong ones in job searching and sharing. Yet, some posit the opposite: job opportunities tend to be shared through strong ties in some business areas. Nevertheless, little empirical research has been conducted to substantiate the hypotheses and unravel the rationales behind them. This paper attempts to contribute empirical evidence to this management field by focusing on the construction waste hauling business in Hong Kong. Four null hypotheses about the relationships between haulers&#39; tie strength and job opportunity sharing (defined as waste hauling order sharing) are proposed, and then a big data set containing 11.7 million waste hauling records is analyzed to test the hypotheses. The analysis shows that, in general, the stronger the tie strength of two haulers, the higher the quantity of job opportunities they share. Among all ties a hauler owns, the greater the proportion of strong ties, the higher the quantity and quality (e.g., shorter distance and less underloading) of job opportunities will be shared. However, these positive effects will be diminished when the strength or proportion exceeds a certain point. These empirical findings not only highlight the strength of strong ties, providing an empirical supplement for the long-standing SWT theory, but also exemplify an exploration of applying SWT theory in the construction management field. Moreover, this study provides practical implications for construction waste hauling businesses to improve efficiency and the public sector to pursue social optimality in construction waste management. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.</abstract>

      <abstract>As economies become increasingly data-driven, big data technologies and
software products are turning into key tools for managing technological
processes in real time for more efficient delivery of public services to
citizens. The change in the interaction between the state and society
implies the creation of a unified state digital ecosystem, centered
around big data. Such paradigm calls for rethinking of public
administration principles ensuring the transition from an electronic
state to a digital one. As a result, the likelihood of creating values
that meet the shifting expectations of citizens in relation to public
services increases.</abstract>

      <abstract>In recent years, technology adoption in Indonesia has begun to use advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve services. This change has had a significant impact on several institutions. This article provides an overview of the many institutions in Indonesia that are leveraging AI. A comprehensive review of 35 papers from the Scopus database was used to develop our methodology. Education, health care, ICT, licensing, transportation, and economic services are all well-represented in the existing literature, which puts AI into practice in various disciplines. We provide a framework for organizing governance research that identifies gaps in the existing literature and suggests future directions for research utilizing technology. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.</abstract>

      <abstract>The rapid generation of data from various sources by the public sector,
private corporations, business associations, and local communities is
referred to as big data. This large and complex dataset is often
regarded as the &#x60;new oil&#39; by public administrations (PAs), and
data-driven approaches are employed to transform it into valuable
insights that can improve governance, transparency, digital services,
and public engagement. The government&#39;s big-data ecosystem (GBDE) is a
result of this initiative. Effective data management is the first step
towards large-scale data analysis, which yields insights that benefit
your work and your customers. However, managing big data throughout its
life cycle is a daunting challenge for public agencies. Despite its
widespread use, big data management is still a significant obstacle. To
address this issue, this study proposes a hybrid approach to secure the
data management life cycle for GBDE. Specifically, we use a combination
of the ECC algorithm with AES 128 BITS encryption to ensure that the
data remain confidential and secure. We identified and analyzed various
data life cycle models through a systematic literature review to create
a data management life cycle for data-driven governments. This approach
enhances the security and privacy of data management and addresses the
challenges faced by public agencies.</abstract>

      <abstract>Malaysian public sectors have invested billions in digitizing systems. Electronic government efforts created much software. Our informal interview taught us that many software projects encountered delays, and several failed. One of the main contributions of software failure is ambiguity in requirements specification (RS). Ambiguity is a familiar requirement smell that causes misinterpretation. Thus, we seek to devise a technique for detecting and improving ambiguous RS in the Malaysian public sector. One of our challenges is that the Malaysian public sector RS is developed in Malay, and most available techniques support English and other major languages. Hence, this paper investigates the automated and semi-automated techniques to detect and improve ambiguous RS. Following the standard guidelines for systematic mapping, review, snowballing, and quality assessment, we studied works from 2010 to 2022 on ambiguity detection and improvement techniques. We chose 42 articles as primary studies from 2,549. As a result, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) are the most promising techniques for automated and semi-automated ambiguous detection models. Furthermore, the ambiguous improvement technique began using deep learning (DL) in 2019. However, most proposed tools are still in the validation phase and are not widely employed, implying that tool development and validation research are progressing slowly. Apart from the generic linguistic context of RS, some research focuses on industrial domain-based RS. Our study shows that additional strategies have been developed to overcome RS-related issues. © (2023) IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.</abstract>

      <abstract>Introduction Pakistan has significantly strengthened its capacity for active case finding (ACF) for tuberculosis (TB) that is being implemented at scale in the country. However, yields of ACF have been lower than expected, raising concerns on its effectiveness in the programmatic setting. Distribution of TB in communities is likely to be spatially heterogeneous and targeting of ACF in areas with higher TB prevalence may help improve yields. The primary aim of SPOT-TB is to investigate whether a policy change to use a geographically targeted approach towards ACF supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) software, MATCH-AI, can improve yields in Pakistan. Methods and analysis SPOT-TB will use a pragmatic, stepped wedge cluster randomised design. A total of 30 mobile X-ray units and their field teams will be randomised to receive the intervention. Site selection for ACF in the intervention areas will be guided primarily through the use of MATCH-AI software that models subdistrict TB prevalence and identifies potential disease hotspots. Control areas will use existing approaches towards site selection that are based on staff knowledge, experience and analysis of historical data. The primary outcome measure is the difference in bacteriologically confirmed incident TB detected in the intervention relative to control areas. All remaining ACF-related procedures and algorithms will remain unaffected by this trial. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Health Services Academy, Islamabad, Pakistan (7-82&#x2F;IERC-HSA&#x2F;2022-52) and from the Common Management Unit for TB, HIV and Malaria, Ministry of Health Services, Regulation and Coordination, Islamabad, Pakistan (26-IRB-CMU-2023). Findings from this study will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and stakeholder meetings in Pakistan with the implementing partners and public-sector officials. Findings will also be presented at local and international medical and public health conferences.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article examines the &#x60;&#x60;digital welfare state&#39;&#39; historically,
presently, and into the future, with a focus on what artificial
intelligence means for welfare surveillance. Drawing on scholarship
about the development of bureaucracy, the welfare state, and automation,
as well as specific examples from the Netherlands, I argue that problems
posed by artificial intelligence in public administration are often
misplaced or misattributed and that the societal challenges we can
expect to encounter in welfare surveillance are more likely to be
historically familiar than technologically novel. New technologies do
provide some new capabilities, which explains the uptake of algorithmic
tools in welfare fraud investigation and the use of chatbots in
assisting with welfare applications. Algorithmic systems are also
increasingly subject to &#x60;&#x60;audits&#39;&#39; and regulations that mandate
accountability. However, many of the key issues in the automation of the
welfare state are the same as identified in scholarship that long
precedes the current hype around artificial intelligence. These issues
include a persistent suspicion of welfare recipients to justify
surveillance as a form of fraud identification, opaque decision-making,
and punitive measures directed against marginalized groups, enacting
harm and reproducing inequalities.</abstract>

      <abstract>This article addresses the directions of change in the area of control of the collection and distribution of public funds, in the context of the possibility of using new technologies, with a view to compliance with the legal standards of a democratic law-governed state and the challenges facing law-makers in properly legislating the use of AI. Issues related to the risks and threats posed by the implementation of new technologies in the public sector regarding technical (e.g. algorithmic bias) and legal (e.g. inadequate regulation of the possibility of using technology by a public administration) aspects are raised, bearing in mind that incorrect regulation of these issues is not without impact on trust in the state and ensuring the protection of democratic values. Analysing the issues related to the implementation of technological solutions to control public finances, it also indicates new areas for control in the public sector, for example the control of algorithm-based applications. © 2023 Anna Zalcewicz, published by Sciendo.</abstract>

      <abstract>Auditing in the public sector is done regularly to ensure efficiency and integrity of the government machinery&#39;s operations and financial management. The data collected during the audit process can be analysed using big data analytic approaches to produce better audit outcomes. This will benefit the government in improving its services to the citizens as well as preventing any unwanted excesses from occurring. Some issues related to this are identified in a case study by interviewing officers at the National Audit Department: the need for adopting big data analytics, technology, training and organisation. These issues can be patterned against the Technology-Organisation-Environment framework and can guide the government to implement big data analytics in a better way for the public sector auditing activities. © School of Engineering, Taylor&#39;s University.</abstract>

      <abstract>As AI technology continues to evolve, it plays an increasingly
significant role in everyday life and social governance. However, the
frequent occurrence of issues such as algorithmic bias, privacy
breaches, and data leaks has led to a crisis of trust in AI among the
public, presenting numerous challenges to social governance.
Establishing technical trust in AI, reducing uncertainties in AI
development, and enhancing its effectiveness in social governance have
become a consensus among policymakers and researchers. By comparing
different types of AI, the paper proposes and conceptualizes the idea of
trustworthy AI, then discusses its characteristics and its value and
impact pathways in social governance. The analysis addresses how
mismatches in technological trust can affect social stability and the
advancement of AI strategies. The paper highlights the potential of
trustworthy AI to improve the efficiency of social governance and solve
complex social problems.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study discusses sustainable design strategies for Japanese public libraries by introducing the time concept. Currently, public libraries in Japan are facing declining utilization and decaying facilities, and many require renovation or reconstruction. We explore how design can help libraries avoid their current dilemmas and cope with the increasing e-books and pandemic-born boom in online learning and communication. Only by addressing these issues and planning for similar situations in the future will libraries manage to achieve their sustainability goals. This requires a systematic rethinking of traditional library design approaches by introducing the time element. We review the development of Japanese public libraries to identify the short- and long-term roles of libraries in cities from an international perspective, based on which we reevaluate the functions of public libraries. As different regions and conceptions of time and space influence people&#39;s needs for space and services, we also explore the view of time in architecture and the unique Japanese time perception. We then discuss possible solutions for libraries in Japan and the feasibility for other countries. We have three main suggestions. 1. A central + local development model.2. A three-stage design process from stable to resilient.3. An operating plan considering the economy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>

      <abstract>The main research question addressed in the paper is related to the possibility of medium-term forecasting of the public debts of the EU member states. The analysis focuses on a broad range of indicators (macroeconomic, fiscal, monetary, global, and convergence) that influence the public debt levels of the EU member states. A machine learning prediction model using random forest regression was approbated with the empirical data. The algorithm was applied in two iterations—a primary iteration with 33 indicators and a secondary iteration with the 8 most significant indicators in terms of their influence and forecasting importance regarding the development of public debt across the EU. The research identifies a change in the medium term (2023–2024) in the group of the four most indebted EU member states, viz., that Spain will be replaced by France, which is an even more systemic economy, and will thus increase the group’s share of the EU’s GDP. The results indicate a logical scenario of rising interest rates with adverse effects for the fiscal imbalances, which will require serious reforms in the public sector of the most indebted EU member states. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Energy efficiency of public sector is an important issue in the context
of smart cities due to the fact that buildings are the largest energy
consumers, especially public buildings such as educational, health,
government and other public institutions that have a large usage
frequency. However, recent developments of machine learning within Big
Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This
paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data
platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing
energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart
city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random
forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction
models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector
buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method,
and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods
has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested
intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and
predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public
buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for
improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data
environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for
developing such a platform that could be used by public administration
to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy
consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings
as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy
management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its
higher quality of service and healthier environment.</abstract>

      <abstract>The paper deals with modeling the cost of energy consumed in public
buildings by leveraging three machine learning methods: artificial
neural networks, CART, and random forest regression trees. Energy
consumption is one of the major issues in global and national policies,
therefore scientific efforts in creating prediction models of energy
consumption and cost are highly important. One of the largest energy
consumers in every state is its public sector, consisting of
educational, health, public administration, military, and other types of
public buildings. Recent technologies based on sensor networks and Big
data platforms enable collection of large amounts of data that could be
used to analyze energy consumption and cost. A real data from Croatian
public sector is used in this paper including a large number of
constructional, energetic, occupational, climate and other attributes.
The algorithms for data pre-processing and modeling by optimizing
parameters are suggested. Three strategies were tested: (1) with all
available variables, (2) with a filter-based variable selection, and (3)
with a wrapper-based variable selection which integrates Boruta
algorithm and random forest. Prediction models of energy cost are
created using two approaches: (a) comparative usage of artificial neural
networks and two types of regression trees, CART and random forest, and
(b) integration of RF-Boruta variable selection and machine learning
methods for prediction. A cross-validation procedure was used to
optimize the artificial neural network and regression tree topology, as
well to select the most appropriate activation function. Along with
creating a prediction model, the aim of the paper was also to extract
the relevant predictors of energy cost in public buildings which are
important in planning the construction or renovation of buildings. The
results have shown that the second approach which integrates machine
learning with Boruta method, where the random forest algorithm is used
for both variable reduction and prediction modeling, has produced a
higher accuracy of prediction than the individual usage of three machine
learning methods. Such findings confirm the potential of hybrid machine
learning methods which are suggested in previous research, but in favor
of random forest method over CART and artificial neural networks.
Regarding the variable selection, the model has extracted heating and
occupational data as the most important, followed by constructional,
cooling, electricity, and lighting attributes. The model could be
implemented in public buildings information systems and their IoT
networks within the concept of smart buildings and smart cities. ? 2021

      <abstract>Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are important toxic organic components in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), whereas the links between PM2.5 toxicity and associated PACs in ambient air are poorly understood. This study investigated the spatial–temporal variations of PACs in PM2.5 collected from 11 sampling sites across a Chinese megacity and characterized the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cytotoxicity induced by organic extracts of PM2.5 based on cellular assays. The extra trees regression model based on machine learning and ridge regression were used to identify the key toxicants among complex PAC mixtures. The total concentrations of these PACs varied from 2.12 to 71.7 ng&#x2F;m3 across the study city, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the main PACs. The spatial variations of the toxicological indicators generally resembled those of the PAC concentrations, and the PM2.5 related to waste treatment facilities exhibited the strongest toxic potencies. The ROS generation was highly correlated with high molecular weight PAHs (MW302 PAHs), followed by PAHs with MW&lt;302 amu and oxygenated PAHs, but not with nitrated PAHs and the plastics additives. The cell mortality showed weak correlations with these organic constituents. The associations between the biological endpoints and these PM2.5-bound contaminants were further confirmed by exposure to authentic chemicals. Four primary sources of PACs were identified, among which coal and biomass combustion sources (30.2% of the total PACs) and industrial sources (31.0%) were predominant. PACs emitted from industrial sources were highly associated with ROS generation in this city. Our findings highlight the potent ROS-generating potential of MW302 PAHs and the importance of industrial sources contributing to PM2.5 toxicity in this megacity, raising public concerns and further administration. © 2023 The Authors</abstract>

      <abstract>Artificial intelligence (AI) and its broad applications are disruptively
transforming the daily lives of human beings and a discussion of the
ethical and privacy issues surrounding AI is a topic of growing
interest, not only among academics but also the general public This
review identifies the key entities (i.e., leading research institutions
and their affiliated countries&#x2F;regions, core research journals, and
communities) that contribute to the research on the ethical and privacy
issues in relation to AI and their intersections using co-occurrence
analysis. Topic analyses profile the topical landscape of AI ethics
using a topical hierarchical tree and the changing interest of society
in AI ethics over time through scientific evolutionary pathways. We also
paired 15 selected AI techniques with 17 major ethical issues and
identify emerging ethical issues from a core set of the most recent
articles published in Nature, Science, and Proceedings of the National
Science Academy of the United States. These insights bridging the
knowledge base of AI techniques and ethical issues in the literature,
are of interest to the AI community and audiences in science policy,
technology management, and public administration. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

      <abstract>Today, artificial intelligence (AI) can be found in nearly every aspect
of travel and tourism, from personalization and recommendation systems
to robotics to conversational systems to intelligent travel agents to
forecasting and prediction tools and systems for language translation.
As a result, this study examines the connection between large-scale big
data analysis and smart tourism, resulting in a massive data platform
for forecasting and providing feedback on smart tourist
developments.This article aims to shed light on the importance of AI in
the travel and tourism sector. Many cybersecurity firms are stepping to
raise their efforts using artificial intelligence to attain this goal
because effective information security is necessary for better
detection.An intelligent all-area-advanced tourism cloud platform is
demonstrated in this paper, as well as how to design the overall system
framework, system structure, and database systems needed to integrate
all of the province&#39;s tourism resources into a single information
resource sharing system.Furthermore, this paper presents an intelligent
decision-support system based on big data to reimagine tourism public
administration and service. It moreover examines the ramifications of
this decision-making mode and implementation procedures. This study
covers the framework operation&#39;s elements, environment features, and
promotion mode by creating a tourism public management and service
framework based on big data. Big data-driven decision-support and
management can overhaul tourism public management and service models.
Cyber threat intelligence and applications, including those that defend
systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from cyber threats, could
significantly impact this tourism industry.The present tourism
industry&#39;s problem-solving efficiency, quality, and services have
increased. The simulation evaluation can promote the public tourism
service in sustainable tourism development with an improved decision
accuracy of 97.21%.</abstract>

      <abstract>In the past two years, with the development of big data technology and the revolutionary innovations it has caused within various industries, there has been a boom in the use of big data to transform and optimize government workflow within the field of public administration. In this paper, we build a theoretical framework through government statistics, focusing on the four elements of government statistics. The decision tree algorithm is used to analyze the indicators of the government statistical work problem, mainly from three aspects: grassroots statistical institutions, government revenue, and government forestry construction statistics. The accuracy of the decision tree algorithm is controlled between 83% and 91%, with a variation range value of 8%, which is more accurate than the other two algorithms. The decision tree algorithm helps improve the efficiency and quality of government statistics, thus contributing to the processing of statistical work problems and reform strategies. This study is important for deepening the reform of the Chinese government administration system, improving the construction of a service-oriented government, ensuring the quality of statistical information, and guiding the benign development of statistical work.  © 2023 Xianwei Zhang et al., published by Sciendo.</abstract>

      <abstract>The use of cloud computing, big data, IoT, and mobile applications in the public transportation industry has resulted in the generation of vast and complex data, of which the large data volume and data variety have posed several obstacles to effective data sensing and processing with high efficiency in a real-time data-driven public transportation management system. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges and to guarantee optimal data availability for data sensing and processing in public transportation perception, a public transportation sensing platform is proposed to collect, integrate, and organize diverse data from different data sources. The proposed data perception platform connects multiple data systems and some edge intelligent perception devices to enable the collection of various types of data, including traveling information of passengers and transaction data of smart cards. To enable the efficient extraction of precise and detailed traveling behavior, an efficient field-level data lineage exploration method is proposed during logical plan generation and is integrated into the FlinkSQL system seamlessly. Furthermore, a row-level fine-grained permission control mechanism is adopted to support flexible data management. With these two techniques, the proposed data management system can support efficient data processing on large amounts of data and conducts comprehensive analysis and application of business data from numerous different sources to realize the value of the data with high data safety. Through operational testing in real environments, the proposed platform has proven highly efficient and effective in managing organizational operations, data assets, data life cycle, offline development, and backend administration over a large amount of various types of public transportation traffic data. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>

      <abstract>As a mature paradigm of network analysis, social network analysis (SNA) is suitable for exploring complicated and interactive relationships in policy research and is of great significance to the innovation and development of public policy research. In this paper, 45 typical articles published in high-ranking journals in the field of public administration were analysed using co-word analysis and qualitative analysis. The application of SNA in public policy studies, including research methods, analytic tools, and basic concepts of network analysis, were systematically reviewed. UCINET software was used to visualize the knowledge network of research topics. The main research topics were classified into five categories: agenda setting, policy network, advocacy coalition, policy learning and diffusion, policy implementation. Finally, this article suggests that network analysis in public administration should be thoroughly re-examined; in particular, scholars should consider the benefits of SNA for public policy research. In the application of SNA to public policy research, it is necessary to broaden the study perspective and scope, further strengthen interdisciplinary theoretical interaction and theoretical innovation, and take advantage of big data and other new technological tools that can develop giant network analysis for public policy. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract>

      <abstract>With advances in networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things, humanoid robots are rising in many areas, including elderly care, companion, education, and services in public sectors. Given their sensing and communication functionality, information leakage and unauthorized access will be of big concern. Very often, authentication techniques for service robots, especially those related to behavioral identification, have been developed, in which behavior models are created using raw data from sensors. However, behavioral-based authentication and re-authentication is still an open area for research, including cold start problems, accuracy, and uncertainty. This paper proposes a hierarchical implicit authentication system by joint built-in sensors and trust evaluation, coined sAuth, which exploits sensor data-based sliding window trust model to identify the service robot and its expected users. In order to mitigate the fluctuations of identification results in the real world environment, the trust evaluation is computed via combining the weighted intermediate identification probability of various small sliding windows. The performance of sAuth is evaluated under different scenarios where we show that (i) approximately 5–7% higher accuracy and 2–18% lower equal error rate can be achieved by our method compared to other works; and (ii) the hierarchical scheme with joint sensors and trust sliding windows improves the authentication accuracy significantly by comparing it with only sensor-based authentication. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>The outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly threatened global public health and produced social problems, which includes relative online collective actions. Based on the life cycle law, focusing on the life cycle process of COVID-19 online collective actions, we carried out both macro-level analysis (big data mining) and micro-level behaviors (Agent-Based Modeling) on pandemic-related online collective actions. We collected 138 related online events with macro-level big data characteristics, and used Agent-Based Modeling to capture micro-level individual behaviors of netizens. We set two kinds of movable agents, Hots (events) and Netizens (individuals), which behave smartly and autonomously. Based on multiple simulations and parametric traversal, we obtained the optimal parameter solution. Under the optimal solutions, we repeated simulations by ten times, and took the mean values as robust outcomes. Simulation outcomes well match the real big data of life cycle trends, and validity and robustness can be achieved. According to multiple criteria (spans, peaks, ratios, and distributions), the fitness between simulations and real big data has been substantially supported. Therefore, our Agent-Based Modeling well grasps the micro-level mechanisms of real-world individuals (netizens), based on which we can predict individual behaviors of netizens and big data trends of specific online events. Based on our model, it is feasible to model, calculate, and even predict evolutionary dynamics and life cycles trends of online collective actions. It facilitates public administrations and social governance. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper presents a review of open data research based on bibliometric analysis of publications in Web of Science from 1998 to 2016. It shows that research on open data has grown rapidly since 2009 with the development of various open data initiatives. We identify the different themes using science mapping and performance analysis. The most important themes are semantic web, open government, and crowdsourcing. The basic and transversal themes are data sharing and public sector information. As for the emerging themes, these are Big Data and open government data. In addition, data journalism, monitoring, and recommender systems are specific themes that deserve special attention. The UK and the USA are the leading publishing countries, both in theoretical and practical research on open data. In China, most researchers focus on practical research, and there have been efforts to promote the development of open data. Papers introducing large-scale projects receive more attention and citation quickly. Recently, researchers have been publishing more on objective topics, including possible issues and dilemmas in the era of Big Data and many problems such as budgets, ownership, licensing, culture, and sustainable development. © 2017 The Author(s).

      <abstract>In public management, intelligent face recognition detection technology plays a very crucial role, which can greatly improve the efficiency of public management and reduce the workload of staff. To address the shortcomings of traditional face detection algorithms such as low detection efficiency and easy overfitting, a face detection model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed in this study, and the structure of CNN was optimized to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed face detection model. To solve the face detection errors caused by illumination differences, a light compensation strategy was proposed to pre-process the data; meanwhile, a Gaussian curvature filtering algorithm was used to enhance the face image and improve the subsequent detection accuracy. On this basis, a face detection model based on improved CNN was designed in this study. Experiments showed that the accuracy of the model reached 99.86% with high accuracy and efficiency, indicating that such method can improve the efficiency of public management and has good application prospects in access control and check-in systems.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

      <abstract>With the progress of urbanization, urban management is facing a series of challenges in the new situation. The scale of the city is growing, urban management problems are increasingly prominent, the urban population is showing a rapid growth trend, and various elements of urban infrastructure management, such as rapid growth and urban expansion, have increased the load of urban infrastructure. To make overall planning for urban transportation, municipal administration, economic industry, and public service, intelligent urban planning and construction came into being. Big data technology provides important support for the construction and development of smart city, which is not only an effective means to improve the design of smart city, but also the premise for the development of smart city. Therefore, this paper first introduces the characteristics of smart city, analyses the application of big data technology in smart city design, and finally evaluates the impact of smart city planning and construction based on big data on economic and social benefits. © 2020 Zihan Zhao and Yuhan Zhang.</abstract>

      <abstract>Drawing on recent research on robust governance, we conceptualize robust crisis communication as a dynamic process centered on evolving public communication demands. We propose a three-dimensional measurement for empirically examining the robustness of government crisis communication in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected 43,642 Twitter messages posted by 50 state governors in the United States from January 1 to June 30, 2020. We applied machine learning algorithms to code the voluminous Twitter data based on messaging topics, sentiments, and interactions. This study found an overall low level of robustness in the governors&#39; crisis communication. Governors most frequently posted reputation management tweets, followed by tweets about the government&#39;s handling of the pandemic. This research presents empirical evidence for the heavy influence of politics on governors&#39; crisis communication strategies and highlights the need to understand and build robust crisis communication. 摘要. 本文借鉴稳健性治理的最新相关研究，提出稳健性危机沟通的概念，将其界定为聚焦于满足危机中持续变化的公众沟通需求的动态沟通过程与模式。基于此概念，本文以新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情中的危机沟通为例，构建三维测量方法，用以检验政府危机沟通在内容主题、情感表达和对话互动三方面的稳健程度。本文收集美国50个州长在2020年1月1日至2020年6月30日期间发布的43,642条推特信息，并应用机器学习对所有信息的主题、情感和互动特征进行编码分析。本文发现美国州长危机沟通的稳健性程度总体偏低。美国州长最经常发布与声誉管理相关的推文，其次是政府的疫情防控措施。文章进一步阐释与例证政治因素对州长危机沟通策略的深刻影响，并强调政府部门理解与践行稳健性风险沟通的必要性与重要性。. © 2022 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>The understanding of people&#39;s inter-regional mobility behaviors, such as predicting the next activity region (AR) or uncovering the intentions for regional mobility, is of great value to public administration or business interests. While there are numerous studies on human mobility, these studies are mainly from a statistical view or study movement behaviors within a region. The work on individual-level inter-regional mobility behavior is limited. To this end, in this article, we propose a dynamic region-relation-aware graph neural network (DRRGNN) for exploring individual mobility behaviors over ARs. Specifically, we aim at developing models that can answer three questions: (1) Which regions are the ARs? (2) Which region will be the next AR, and (3) Why do people make this regional mobility? To achieve these tasks, we first propose a method to find out people&#39;s ARs. Then, the designed model integrates a dynamic graph convolution network (DGCN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to depict the evolution of relations between ARs and mine the regional mobility patterns. In the learning process, the model further considers peoples&#39; profiles and visited point-of-interest (POIs). Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that the proposed model can significantly improve accuracy for both the next AR prediction and mobility intention prediction. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.</abstract>

      <abstract>Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a linear programming methodology for measuring the efficiency of Decision Making Units (DMUs) to improve organizational performance in the private and public sectors. However, if a new DMU needs to be known its efficiency score, the DEA analysis would have to be re-conducted, especially nowadays, datasets from many fields have been growing rapidly in the real world, which will need a huge amount of computation. Following the previous studies, this paper aims to establish a linkage between the DEA method and machine learning (ML) algorithms, and proposes an alternative way that combines DEA with ML (ML-DEA) algorithms to measure and predict the DEA efficiency of DMUs. Four ML-DEA algorithms are discussed, namely DEA-CCR model combined with back-propagation neural network (BPNN-DEA), with genetic algorithm (GA) integrated with back-propagation neural network (GANN-DEA), with support vector machines (SVM-DEA), and with improved support vector machines (ISVM-DEA), respectively. To illustrate the applicability of above models, the performance of Chinese manufacturing listed companies in 2016 is measured, predicted and compared with the DEA efficiency scores obtained by the DEA-CCR model. The empirical results show that the average accuracy of the predicted efficiency of DMUs is about 94%, and the comprehensive performance order of four ML-DEA algorithms ranked from good to poor is GANN-DEA, BPNN-DEA, ISVM-DEA, and SVM-DEA. © 2020 China Science Publishing &amp; Media Ltd.</abstract>

      <abstract>Since the outbreak of the world-wide novel coronavirus pandemic, crowd counting in public areas, such as in shopping centers and in commercial streets, has gained popularity among public health administrations for preventing the crowds from gathering. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive method for crowd counting based on Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) by using common commercial wireless routers. Compared with previous researches on device-free crowd counting, our proposed method is more adaptive to the change of environment and can achieve high accuracy of crowd count estimation. Because the distance between access point (AP) and monitor point (MP) is typically non-fixed in real-world applications, the strength of received signals varies and makes the traditional amplitude-related models to perform poorly in different environments. In order to achieve adaptivity of the crowd count estimation model, we used convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to extract features from correlation coefficient matrix of subcarriers which are insensitive to the change of received signal strength. We conducted experiments in university classroom settings and our model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.79% in estimating a variable number of participants. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

      <abstract>An economy based on open and loose networks with information and big data platforms designed for sharing and hacking is being thrust upon us. How might this impact the way we govern and how administrative work gets done? When addressing public issues, administrators have always faced complexities of governance, including divergent structures and procedures. These are most apparent when administrators experience slippage among groups and between steps, lack clarity on responsibility, and uncover variations in assumptions about activities and goals. An anxious and confused public sector seeks clarity in the face of incoherent choices often associated with fundamental societal change. This can lead to noncongruent horizons of understanding that are “normal” (i.e., the way the system works), not aberrant (i.e., a scandal). Therefore, shared understanding and clear answers might not exist. Administrators may serve most efficiently by enacting authority that encourages debate, discussion, and deliberation. This paves the way for engaging the public by accepting that possible solutions: (1) exist somewhere in between and are situational; (2) are not “owned” by any one person and&#x2F;or technology; and (3) require an interpretive dimension for learning and understanding. We argue that public administrators in an evolving economy are no longer merely rule or contract bearers, but instead agents of deliberation operating platforms for discovery. A multitude of necessary and relevant skills is associated within changing conditions; one we find most compelling involves enacting a hermeneutic mind. © 2018, Copyright © Public Administration Theory Network.</abstract>

      <abstract>To lay the foundation for the special issue that this research article introduces, we present 1) a systematic review of existing literature on the implications of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public governance and 2) develop a research agenda. First, an assessment based on 26 articles on this topic reveals much exploratory, conceptual, qualitative, and practice-driven research in studies reflecting the increasing complexities of using AI in government – and the resulting implications, opportunities, and risks thereof for public governance. Second, based on both the literature review and the analysis of articles included in this special issue, we propose a research agenda comprising eight process-related recommendations and seven content-related recommendations. Process-wise, future research on the implications of the use of AI for public governance should move towards more public sector-focused, empirical, multidisciplinary, and explanatory research while focusing more on specific forms of AI rather than AI in general. Content-wise, our research agenda calls for the development of solid, multidisciplinary, theoretical foundations for the use of AI for public governance, as well as investigations of effective implementation, engagement, and communication plans for government strategies on AI use in the public sector. Finally, the research agenda calls for research into managing the risks of AI use in the public sector, governance modes possible for AI use in the public sector, performance and impact measurement of AI use in government, and impact evaluation of scaling-up AI usage in the public sector. © 2021 The Author(s)</abstract>
