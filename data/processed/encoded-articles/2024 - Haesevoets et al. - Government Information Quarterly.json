    "research_description": "The study explores UK citizens' perceptions of AI involvement in public sector decision-making. It investigates how citizens view the legitimacy, decisional weight, and the advisory role of AI compared to human decision-makers like politicians, citizens, and experts. The research reveals a general preference for AI to provide input rather than take full decisional control, with findings indicating a perception of higher output legitimacy for AI in low ideologically charged decisions.",
    "research_results": "Citizens prefer AI to have an advisory role in public sector decisions rather than a full decision-making role. The findings show that AI is perceived to contribute to the efficiency of decision-making, especially in low ideologically charged contexts, though skepticism persists regarding its involvement in more ideologically charged decisions.",
    "future_research": "Future research could explore how perceptions of AI involvement in decision-making vary across different cultural contexts and levels of trust in public governance."
