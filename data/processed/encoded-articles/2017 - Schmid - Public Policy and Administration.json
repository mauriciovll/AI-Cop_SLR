It explains how public sector organizations can use Big Data to improve decision-making, control, and efficiency. The article focuses on the importance of data-driven decision-making in public management and highlights the transformative potential of Big Data in enhancing public controlling functions.", "research_results": "The study finds that Big Data has the potential to significantly improve public sector efficiency and effectiveness. However, there are numerous challenges, such as data protection concerns and the lack of a competitive environment in the public sector, which hinder the implementation of Big Data solutions. The article suggests that public controlling should play a leading role in integrating Big Data into decision-making processes.", "future_research": "Further research could explore the practical applications of Big Data in other public sector functions beyond controlling, as well as investigate ways to address the ethical and operational challenges associated with Big Data in public management."}
