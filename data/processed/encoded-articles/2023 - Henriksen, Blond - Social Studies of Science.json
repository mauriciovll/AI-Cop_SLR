Designing predictive systems for the public sector", "doi_number": "10.1177/03063127231163756", "research_approach": "Qualitative", "research_method": "Field study", "analysis_techniques": "Semi-structured interviews; Document analysis; Observation", "research_topics": "Implementation and governance", "research_context": "Public services/healthcare; Public management/accounting", "analysis_level": "Meso", "geographical_context": "Scandinavia", "government_level": "National", "theoretical_background": "Public value theory; Socio-technical systems theory", "technology_discussed": "Artificial Intelligence; Machine learning", "research_description": "The article explores how AI is designed and implemented in the public sector through two case studies in healthcare and accounting. It critiques the human-centered AI narrative by showing how AI systems are being developed primarily for managerial efficiency, rather than enhancing human labor.", "research_results": "The study reveals that AI systems are designed for cost-efficiency and top-down implementation, benefitting managers rather than frontline workers. It questions the ideal of human-centered AI and suggests that more effort is needed to rethink human-machine relationships in the context of public governance.", "future_research": "Future studies should focus on reconceptualizing human-machine partnerships, especially in the context of AI governance and the ethical implications of automating public sector functions."}
