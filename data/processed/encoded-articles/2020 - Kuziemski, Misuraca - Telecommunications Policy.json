"research_description": "This paper examines AI governance in the public sector, focusing on case studies from Canada, Finland, and Poland. It discusses the challenges and benefits of using automated decision-making systems in public governance, highlighting the risks associated with intensifying power asymmetries and the need for common regulatory frameworks.",
"research_results": "The study found that while AI can improve efficiency in the public sector, it often intensifies existing power asymmetries, particularly in immigration control, employment services, and citizen-facing digital services. The authors call for more robust frameworks to ensure algorithmic accountability and fairness.",
"future_research": "Future research should explore frameworks for AI governance that balance efficiency with accountability and fairness, focusing on how different stakeholders perceive the impact of AI-driven decisions on public trust and democracy."}
