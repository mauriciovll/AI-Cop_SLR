The method is applied to a case study involving IT service procurement for e-government services in a local government in Russia, demonstrating how BDA and FCMs can improve decision-making efficiency and effectiveness.", "research_results": "The FCM-based approach was successful in prioritizing IT services by evaluating their multidimensional impact. The case study demonstrated how decision-makers can integrate qualitative and quantitative data to make more informed decisions. The results highlight the importance of considering multiple factors in IT procurement, including social and economic impacts.", "future_research": "Future research could explore the application of FCM and BDA to other public sector decision-making problems, such as infrastructure investment or social services. Additionally, further investigation into optimizing FCM weight matrices in complex decision-making environments is recommended."}
