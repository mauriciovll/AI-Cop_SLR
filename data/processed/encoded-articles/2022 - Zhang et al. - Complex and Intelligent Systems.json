Using big data mining and Agent-Based Modeling, it captures the behaviors of netizens in pandemic-related online events. The study aims to predict evolutionary dynamics of such actions, using parameters like life cycle trends, attention allocation, and substitution effects.", "research_results": "The study finds that attention allocation and substitution effects are key drivers of online collective actions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simulation outcomes closely match the real big data trends of online events.", "future_research": "Future studies could investigate the role of emerging technologies such as Machine Learning in refining predictions of online collective actions."}
