Using interviews, focus groups, and workshops, the paper identifies two incongruent technological frames that shape how different actors in the administration perceive and use data in the smart-city paradigm.", "research_results": "The study found two incongruent technological frames: the 'experimentalist's credo,' which views data as open and useful for agile experimentation, and the 'data owner's vocation,' which treats data as political and context-dependent. These frames highlight the complexities of integrating smart-city ideals into public administration.", "future_research": "Future research could investigate how other smart-city projects address the incongruences in data governance and explore how technological frames influence the implementation of smart-city initiatives in different cities."}
