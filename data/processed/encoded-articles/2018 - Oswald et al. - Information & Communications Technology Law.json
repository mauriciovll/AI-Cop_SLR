It critiques the potential societal and legal impacts of such tools, proposing the concept of 'experimental proportionality' and introducing the ALGO-CARE framework to address ethical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in law enforcement.", "research_results": "The study highlights both the benefits and challenges of using algorithmic risk assessment tools, especially in the context of policing. It stresses the need for careful oversight, transparency, and balancing individual rights with public safety. The article also underscores the experimental nature of these tools and the importance of continuous validation and legal scrutiny.", "future_research": "Future research should focus on the long-term impacts of algorithmic policing tools, further development of ethical frameworks, and broader studies on how these tools affect decision-making in law enforcement and public administration."}
