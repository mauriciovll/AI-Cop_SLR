    "research_description": "The article investigates the rationales, translations, and potentials for critical reflection embedded in the development of a decision support system (DSS) aimed at helping social workers assess child protection cases. The study focuses on how key actors in Copenhagen Municipality develop and interpret the system in child protection services.",
    "research_results": "The DSS helps manage complexity in child welfare services by merging technological rationales with social worker responsibilities. However, tensions arise from translating these technological tools into practical use, and ambiguity around decision-making persists.",
    "future_research": "Future research should explore long-term impacts of decision support systems in child protection, particularly on how they influence the division of responsibility between human decision-makers and AI tools."
