    "research_description": "This study explores citizens\u2019 acceptance of AI in public services through policy-capturing experiments in six scenarios. Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT) is applied to understand why and when AI is accepted compared to human-provided services.",
    "research_results": "The results show that AI is preferred over human services in general services but not in specific services. Key factors driving acceptance are reasons against AI, such as concerns about lack of transparency and trust.",
    "future_research": "Future research should focus on increasing transparency and trust in AI, especially in specific public services, and further explore citizen involvement in AI-based decision-making."
