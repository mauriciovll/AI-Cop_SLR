  "research_description": "This study investigates the use of AI to geographically target active case finding for tuberculosis (TB) in Pakistan, using AI-based software (MATCH-AI) to predict TB hotspots. The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-based targeting compared to traditional methods in improving TB detection rates.",
  "research_results": "The protocol outlines the implementation of a stepped wedge cluster randomised control trial, using Bayesian modeling to evaluate the impact of AI-driven geographical targeting on TB case detection. The expected outcome is increased TB case detection in areas targeted by AI.",
  "future_research": "Future research could investigate the scalability of AI-based targeting methods for TB detection in other high-burden regions, as well as assess the cost-effectiveness and ethical considerations of AI-driven healthcare interventions."
