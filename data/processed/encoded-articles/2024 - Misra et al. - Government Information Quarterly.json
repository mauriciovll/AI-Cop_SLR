  "research_description": "This study develops a person-environment fit framework for the implementation of AI in the public sector, focusing on emergency management. The research uses an embedded mixed methods design, incorporating both qualitative thematic analysis and quantitative survey data, to explore the factors influencing the successful integration of AI technologies in public sector operations, focusing on individual perceptions and adaptability to AI.",
  "research_results": "The findings highlight the critical role of individual perceptions, organizational culture, and adaptability in AI adoption. The person-environment fit theory is applied to understand how AI can enhance efficiency in emergency management, while also addressing challenges related to human-technology interaction.",
  "future_research": "Future research should investigate the application of this framework across other public sector domains, such as healthcare and public safety, to further refine the model and test its scalability in different environments."
