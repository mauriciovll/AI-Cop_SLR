It compares how responsibility for HAVs is discussed between U.S. policy makers and technology experts, highlighting the gap between the enthusiasm for HAVs and the ethical and legal considerations lagging behind the technology's development.", "research_results": "The analysis found that while U.S. policy makers are increasingly engaged with HAV technology, the policy language on responsibility and safety is underdeveloped compared to the discussions among technology experts.", "future_research": "Further research could examine how responsibility for HAV safety could be better integrated into U.S. federal policy, particularly with regard to ethical and legal considerations for autonomous systems."}
