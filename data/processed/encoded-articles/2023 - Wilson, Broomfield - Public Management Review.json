    "research_description": "This study applies boundary theory to examine how public sector managers in Norway learn about implementing AI in their organizations. Through a qualitative case study, it explores how managers overcome organizational and intergovernmental boundaries in an informal learning forum, focusing on their individual learning processes and the role of peer networks in acquiring procedural knowledge for AI implementation.",
    "research_results": "The study highlights that unstructured learning fora are effective for transferring procedural knowledge but less so for declarative knowledge about AI, emphasizing the importance of social trust and peer networks.",
    "future_research": "Future studies could explore how different types of organizational boundaries affect learning in larger and more complex public sector networks."
