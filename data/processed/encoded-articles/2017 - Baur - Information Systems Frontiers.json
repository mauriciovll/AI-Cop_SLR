"research_description": "This paper presents the development of a framework called MarketMiner to handle large amounts of user-generated content (UGC) from multiple languages, using it to enhance insights into public administration and business contexts. It explores applications in the automotive industry and the public sector, particularly focusing on refugee challenges in the European Union.",
"research_results": "MarketMiner significantly improves the ability to gather and analyze UGC from multiple languages. Its modular structure allows for easy adaptation to different sectors, demonstrating utility in both commercial (automotive) and public (refugee integration) contexts.",
"future_research": "Future research could explore broader public sector applications of MarketMiner, particularly in other non-European regions and additional industries where multi-language UGC is prevalent."}
