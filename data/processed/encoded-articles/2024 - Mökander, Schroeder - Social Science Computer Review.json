  "research_description": "This study explores the role of AI in optimizing tax policy in the public sector by extending processes of rationalization and bureaucratization. Drawing from Weberian rationalization, it critically examines how AI can enhance efficiency in governance while potentially limiting human autonomy. The methodology involves theoretical analysis supported by case studies of AI applications in tax optimization, with a focus on ethical and social implications.",
  "research_results": "The paper highlights that AI-driven tax policy optimization could streamline decision-making but also heighten concerns around the loss of human discretion and autonomy. It draws attention to the tension between efficiency and ethical governance, especially as it pertains to citizen-state relationships.",
  "future_research": "Future studies should examine AI's broader impacts on other sectors of public policy, expanding on the ethical implications of automating decision-making in areas like healthcare and education."
