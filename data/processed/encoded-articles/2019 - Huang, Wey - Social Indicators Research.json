It uses the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and big data to support decision-making and urban planning, particularly in revitalizing urban spaces for public use, such as educational centers, health facilities, and public housing.", "research_results": "The study successfully applied the ANP model to evaluate and prioritize reuse strategies based on social, economic, and urban development indicators. The key findings suggest that integrating big data into planning can significantly enhance decision transparency and the effectiveness of adaptive reuse policies for school lands.", "future_research": "Future research could focus on expanding the use of big data in other urban planning domains and exploring the integration of IoT data with ANP models to enhance predictive capabilities and decision-making processes."}
