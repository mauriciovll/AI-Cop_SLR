    "research_description": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of tutoring programs designed for at-risk students using a machine learning model. Kohonen self-organising maps (SOMs) were employed to cluster students based on various factors, such as their characteristics, program type, and academic performance, to inform public administrations about social return on investment.",
    "research_results": "The study shows that tutoring programs effectively reduce school failure and increase the engagement of students at risk, especially through tailored program types.",
    "future_research": "Further analysis of different regions and post-pandemic years could enhance the generalizability of the findings and improve future tutoring programs."
