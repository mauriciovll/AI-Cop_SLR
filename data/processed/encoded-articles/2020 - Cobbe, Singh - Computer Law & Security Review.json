It argues that reviewability offers a more holistic approach than explanations by focusing on the socio-technical processes involved in decision-making.", "research_results": "The study concludes that reviewability could serve as an effective framework for accountability in automated decision-making by focusing on both technical and organisational components of the process.", "future_research": "Further research is needed to explore how reviewability can be implemented in various contexts and to develop appropriate record-keeping mechanisms for different stages of the decision-making process."}
