It discusses data science and artificial intelligence (DSAI) in public sector governance, focusing on four key macro-themes: data decompression, robotic devices, partitioning state functions, and administrative holism.", "research_results": "The study identifies important implications for public administration, including the reshaping of state organizations, enhanced capabilities of public agencies, and the need for new administrative choices in response to DSAI advancements.", "future_research": "Further research is required to investigate the long-term effects of DSAI on state functions and public sector performance, including the development of a research agenda on the third wave of digital era governance."}
