It highlights the use of geospatial technology and cloud computing to generate and integrate synthetic urban metrics, enabling data-driven urban decision-making.", "research_results": "SUDS provides key insights into intra-city dynamics by generating small-area urban indicators based on real-time or near-real-time data. The system was tested with data from housing, transport, and employment, revealing spatial variations and inequalities in urban services at intra-city levels.", "future_research": "Future research could focus on the integration of additional data sources, such as IoT and user-generated content, into SUDS to enhance urban predictive analytics and decision-making capabilities."}
