    "research_description": "The article explores the role of AI and digital technologies in transforming public sector bureaucracies. It analyzes the increasing reliance on advanced computing technologies in public administration and their potential to reinforce, rather than eliminate, bureaucratic structures.",
    "research_results": "The authors argue that AI and other advanced technologies are enhancing bureaucratic tendencies by increasing speed, formalization, and data-driven decision-making. Bureaucracy, rather than being in decline, is being reinforced through these technological advancements.",
    "future_research": "Further studies should explore the long-term impacts of AI and digital technologies on public administration, particularly in how they affect transparency, accountability, and the role of human discretion in decision-making."
