It combines research on e-government and evidence-based policymaking with current discussions on government and technology, highlighting three themes: institutional capacity for Big Data, the use of Big Data in digital public services, and Big Data's entry into the policy cycle.", "research_results": "Big Data offers significant potential for improving public services and policymaking, but institutional barriers and capacity bottlenecks limit its effective use. Case studies in education, healthcare, crisis management, and environmental policy show that while Big Data can enhance decision-making, its application requires more time to overcome governance challenges.", "future_research": "Further research could focus on improving institutional capacity for Big Data use and explore how procedural and substantive policy instruments can be better aligned to leverage Big Data's potential across various policy domains."}
