    "research_description": "The article explores the gap between the discourse of \u2018ethical artificial intelligence\u2019 in Australia and its actual implementation in public sector welfare services. Through institutional ethnography, the authors highlight how AI is deployed under the guise of ethical principles to reinforce existing public management strategies.",
    "research_results": "The study finds that ethical principles are espoused but not reflected in the implementation of AI systems in welfare services. AI is implemented in ways that obscure transparency and accountability, resulting in social harm, particularly to vulnerable populations.",
    "future_research": "Future research should investigate how AI technologies in the public sector can be designed and implemented in a manner that aligns with genuine ethical considerations, including increased transparency, accountability, and public involvement."
