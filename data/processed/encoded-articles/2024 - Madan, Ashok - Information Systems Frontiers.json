  "research_description": "This paper explores factors that affect the sensemaking of AI benefits in Canadian public administration using mixed methods. The study includes a PLS-SEM analysis with 272 participants and interviews with 38 participants, investigating the effects of institutional pressures and consultant influence on AI adoption.",
  "research_results": "Service coercive pressures significantly impact perceived AI benefits, while consultant pressures are key drivers of institutional pressures. A sensemaking model is developed, showing how institutional pressures influence AI adoption.",
  "future_research": "Future research could explore AI adoption in different public sectors or expand the sensemaking model to other technology innovations."
