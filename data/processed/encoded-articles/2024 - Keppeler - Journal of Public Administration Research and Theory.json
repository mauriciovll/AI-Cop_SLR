    "research_description": "This study analyzes the disclosure effects and explores the deployment of an AI application in public sector recruitment through a preregistered field experiment. The results show that disclosing AI use leads to less interest among job candidates, while the AI application shows potential efficiency gains in recruitment processes.",
    "research_results": "The findings indicate that disclosing AI applications significantly decreases candidates' interest in job offers. However, the AI application demonstrates efficiency in predicting person-job fit, providing potential benefits for public sector recruitment.",
    "future_research": "Future studies could further investigate the interplay between AI disclosure, algorithm aversion, and the effectiveness of AI applications in public sector contexts."
