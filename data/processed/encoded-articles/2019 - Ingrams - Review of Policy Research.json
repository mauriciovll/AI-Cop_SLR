It explores the impacts of big data on governance in three policy areas, identifying tensions between citizen autonomy and top-down control by public institutions.", "research_results": "The study reveals that big data can have conflicting impacts on democratic governance, affecting both citizen autonomy and institutional control. It suggests that policy efforts are needed to balance these dimensions, especially in areas like elections, tax policy, and public services.", "future_research": "Future research could focus on expanding the framework for understanding the democratic implications of big data in other policy domains and governance systems."}
