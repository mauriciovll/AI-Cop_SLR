  "research_description": "This study explores how citizens generate value when interacting with virtual agents (VA) in the public sector. It uses transcripts from citizen interactions with VAs to identify key dimensions of value-in-use and examines how citizens experience both positive and negative outcomes from their use of these services. It employs the Gioia methodology and CIT to analyze feedback and explore the theoretical underpinnings of value co-creation in e-government.",
  "research_results": "The study identifies seven dimensions of value-in-use in VA interactions, including pathway to human support, engagement/interaction, and personalization. It highlights that while many users derive positive value from VAs, issues such as lack of common understanding and impersonal responses may limit value generation.",
  "future_research": "Future studies could explore VA use in other public sectors and examine how different demographic factors (e.g., age, education) influence citizen perceptions of value-in-use."
