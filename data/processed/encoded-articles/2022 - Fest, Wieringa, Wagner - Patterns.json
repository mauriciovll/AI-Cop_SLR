    "research_description": "The article examines how ethical and legal frameworks influence the everyday practices of public sector data professionals in the Netherlands. It focuses on two cases: municipalities and the Netherlands Police. The authors explore the gap between high-level frameworks and their practical application in day-to-day decision making.",

Data professionals rely on discretion and informal practices due to the lack of concrete guidance from the frameworks. The article highlights the need for greater data literacy and operationalization of these frameworks.",
