    "research_description": "The article critically examines the European Union Public Sector Information policy and its focus on fostering a data-driven economy. It explores how the regulatory and policy frameworks prioritize economic growth over individual rights and democratic values.",
    "research_results": "The study argues that economic considerations have dominated the EU's PSI policy, while concerns about democracy and fundamental rights have received far less attention. The findings suggest a need for more balanced policymaking that incorporates these ethical considerations.",
    "future_research": "Future research should explore how policymakers can better balance economic growth with the protection of fundamental rights, particularly in the context of the data-driven economy."
