It evaluates whether these agencies can address these tensions effectively and discusses the importance of citizen values such as participation and openness in big data governance.", "research_results": "The study finds that public information agencies in both countries have a capacity that is strongly tilted toward technocratic values, with limited capacity to address participative values. Five propositions are made regarding where the tensions between technocratic and citizen values lie in big data governance, suggesting that more attention is needed on balancing these values.", "future_research": "Future research should focus on expanding the framework to explore the role of public values in other regions and public sectors, and further investigate the capacity of public information agencies to support citizen values in big data programs."}
