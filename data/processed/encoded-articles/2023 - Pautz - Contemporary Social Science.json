    "research_description": "This article explores the use of AI by the Scottish Government, focusing on policy-making processes, concerns, and obstacles. The research utilizes semi-structured interviews with government employees, experts, and representatives from AI and Big Data organizations. The article identifies the limited use of AI in Scotland and highlights factors such as risk aversion and a lack of digital maturity as key barriers.",
    "research_results": "The Scottish Government's use of AI remains minimal, limited to internal functions and data analysis. Concerns over digital maturity and ethical implications, along with a general reluctance to embrace AI in policy making, are significant factors. While initiatives are underway, there is a need for greater expertise and infrastructure to expand AI usage in policy contexts.",
    "future_research": "Future research could explore how governments can develop greater digital maturity and integrate AI more effectively in policy making. Additional case studies on other countries could offer comparative insights into AI governance."
