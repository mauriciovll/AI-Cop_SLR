It develops a framework for measuring organizational readiness, which includes factors like alignment, maturity, and capabilities for big data use. The study is based on case studies and exploratory interviews conducted with 11 organizations in the Dutch public sector.", "research_results": "The study found that while many organizations are technically capable of using big data, they are hindered by misalignment between big data applications and organizational tasks, as well as limitations in maturity and inter-organizational collaboration. The proposed framework helps identify areas for improvement, such as strengthening data governance and developing data science expertise.", "future_research": "Further research should focus on expanding the framework and testing its applicability in different national contexts. Additionally, future studies could explore strategies to overcome the barriers to big data implementation, particularly in terms of data governance and inter-organizational data sharing."}
