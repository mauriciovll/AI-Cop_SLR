It explores how three groups of stakeholders (government policy-makers, hospital managers/doctors, and IT firm managers) frame the challenges related to AI adoption.", "research_results": "The findings show that stakeholders have diverse and sometimes contradictory views on the challenges of AI adoption. Hospital managers emphasize economic challenges, while IT firms focus on social challenges, and government policy-makers are concerned with regulatory and ethical issues.", "future_research": "Further research could investigate the long-term impacts of AI adoption in healthcare and explore how to create policies that reconcile the different perspectives of stakeholders in AI governance."}
