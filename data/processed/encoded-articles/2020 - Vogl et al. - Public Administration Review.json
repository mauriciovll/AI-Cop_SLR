  "research_description": "The article explores the early adoption of smart technologies, particularly AI and predictive analytics, in local authorities in the UK. It examines how these technologies affect public service delivery, emphasizing the emergence of 'algorithmic bureaucracy' and the socio-technical relationships between public administrators and algorithms.",
  "research_results": "Findings indicate that smart technologies are being adopted in local authorities, leading to a new form of bureaucratic organization where human decision-making is augmented by computational algorithms. However, the adoption is at a nascent stage, with challenges in integrating these technologies into traditional public administration practices.",
  "future_research": "Future research should examine how smart technologies can foster positive feedback loops in public service delivery and how they might support the shift from procedural equality to equality of outcomes."
