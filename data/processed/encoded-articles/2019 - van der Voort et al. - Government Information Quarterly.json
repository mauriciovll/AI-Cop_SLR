It examines how big data impacts both data analysts and decision makers, distinguishing between rational and political views.", "research_results": "The findings reveal that while big data enhances the information available to decision makers, it also provides opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests, affecting decision-making dynamics. The political view highlights how analysts can influence outcomes, while decision makers navigate data to align with their goals.", "future_research": "Future research could explore how big data can be integrated into decision-making processes in a way that balances rational analysis and political interests, and how to improve transparency in these processes."}
