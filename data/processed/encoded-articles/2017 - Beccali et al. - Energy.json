The study focuses on 151 public buildings and leverages ANN to predict energy performance and select appropriate retrofit actions to enhance energy efficiency.", "research_results": "The ANN-based decision support tool effectively predicts energy performance and provides tailored recommendations for retrofit actions. Results indicate that upgrading the HVAC system and improving building envelopes can significantly reduce energy consumption.", "future_research": "Further research could explore expanding the ANN-based tool to other geographical regions and building types, as well as integrating renewable energy sources for deeper energy savings."}
