It presents a case study of an integrated data model for children\u2019s services in Kent County Council, examining how Big Data can improve service delivery, and highlighting barriers such as data silos, ethical concerns, and IT infrastructure limitations.", "research_results": "The study found that while Big Data could improve service delivery and cost-effectiveness in local governments, several barriers exist, including data silos, lack of data-sharing agreements, and ethical concerns related to data privacy. The case study of Kent County Council demonstrated that integrating data from multiple services can enhance decision-making but requires overcoming significant institutional challenges.", "future_research": "Future research should focus on how to address the barriers to Big Data integration in local governments, particularly in terms of creating data-sharing agreements and addressing ethical concerns. Studies on the long-term impact of Big Data use in local governments would also be valuable."}
